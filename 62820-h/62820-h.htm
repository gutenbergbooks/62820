</div>
<p>Old Mr. Edward Mottisfont looked over the
edge of the sheet at David Blake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My nephew Edward is most undoubtedly
and indisputably a prig&mdash;a damned prig,&rdquo; he
added thoughtfully after a moment&rsquo;s pause for
reflection. As he reflected his black eyes danced
from David&rsquo;s face to a crayon drawing which
hung on the panelled wall above the mantelpiece.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>&ldquo;His mother&rsquo;s fault,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not
so bad in a woman, and she was pretty,
which Edward ain&rsquo;t. Pretty and a prig my
sister Sarah&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a faint emphasis on the word sister,
and David remembered having heard his mother
say that both Edward and William Mottisfont
had been in love with the girl whom William
married. &ldquo;And a plain prig my nephew Edward,&rdquo;
continued the old gentleman. &ldquo;Damn it all, David,
why can&rsquo;t I leave my money to you instead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>David laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I shouldn&rsquo;t take it, sir,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>He was sitting, most unprofessionally, on the
edge of his patient&rsquo;s large four-post bed. Old
Mr. Edward Mottisfont looked at him quizzically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much would you take&mdash;eh, David?
Come now&mdash;say&mdash;how much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>David laughed again. His grey eyes twinkled.
&ldquo;Nary penny, sir,&rdquo; he said, swinging his arm over
the great carved post beside him. There were
cherubs&rsquo; heads upon it, a fact that had always
amused its owner considerably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said old Mr. Mottisfont, and for
the first time his thin voice was tinged with
earnestness. &ldquo;Nonsense, David. Why! I&rsquo;ve left
you five thousand pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>David started. His eyes changed. They were
very deep-set eyes. It was only when he laughed
that they appeared grey. When he was serious
they were so dark as to look black. Apparently
he was moved and concerned. His voice took a
boyish tone. &ldquo;Oh, I say, sir&mdash;but you mustn&rsquo;t&mdash;I
can&rsquo;t take it, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not, pray?&rdquo; This was Mr. Mottisfont
at his most sarcastic.</p>
<p>David got the better of his momentary
embarrassment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t forget that you&rsquo;ve thought of it, sir,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t benefit under a patient&rsquo;s
will. I haven&rsquo;t got many principles, but that&rsquo;s
one of them. My father drummed it into me
from the time I was about seven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Mr. Edward Mottisfont lifted the thin
eyebrows that had contrived to remain coal-black,
although his hair was white. They gave him a
Mephistophelean appearance of which he was
rather proud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very fine and highfalutin,&rdquo; he observed.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an exceedingly upright young man, David.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David roared.</p>
<p>After a moment the old gentleman&rsquo;s lips gave
way at the corners, and he laughed too.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Lord, David, who&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; thought it of
you!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t take a thousand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>David shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not five hundred?&rdquo;</p>
<p>David grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not five pence,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Old Mr. Mottisfont glared at him for a moment.
&ldquo;Prig,&rdquo; he observed with great conciseness. Then
he pursed up his lips, felt under his pillow, and
pulled out a long folded paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the more for Edward,&rdquo; he said maliciously.
&ldquo;All the more for Edward, and all the more reason
for Edward to wish me dead. I wonder he don&rsquo;t
poison me. Perhaps he will. Oh, Lord, I&rsquo;d give
something to see Edward tried for murder!
Think of it, David&mdash;only think of it&mdash;Twelve
British Citizens in one box&mdash;Edward in another&mdash;all
the British Citizens looking at Edward, and
Edward looking as if he was in church, and wondering
if the moth was getting into his collections,
and if any one would care for &rsquo;em when he was
dead and gone. Eh, David? Eh, David? And
Mary&mdash;like Niobe, all tears&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>David had been chuckling to himself, but at the
mention of Edward&rsquo;s wife his face changed a
little. He continued to laugh, but his eyes hardened,
and he interrupted his patient: &ldquo;Come,
sir, you mustn&rsquo;t tire yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>&ldquo;Like Niobe, all tears,&rdquo; repeated Mr. Mottisfont,
obstinately. &ldquo;Sweetly pretty she&rsquo;d look too&mdash;eh,
David? Edward&rsquo;s a lucky dog, ain&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>David&rsquo;s eyes flashed once and then hardened
still more. His chin was very square.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, sir,&rdquo; he repeated, and looked steadily
at the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beast&mdash;ain&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; said old Mr. Mottisfont
with the utmost cheerfulness. He occupied himself
with arranging the bedclothes in an accurate
line across his chest. As he did so, his hand
touched the long folded paper, and he gave it an
impatient push.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a damn nuisance, David,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made my will once, and now I&rsquo;ve to make it
all over again just to please you. All the whole
blessed thing over again, from &lsquo;I, Edward Morell
Mottisfont,&rsquo; down to &lsquo;I deliver this my act and
deed.&rsquo; Oh, Lord, what a bore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Fenwick,&rdquo; suggested David, and old Mr.
Edward Mottisfont flared into sudden wrath.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me of lawyers,&rdquo; he said violently.
&ldquo;I know enough law to make a will they can&rsquo;t
upset. Don&rsquo;t talk of &rsquo;em. Sharks and robbers.
Worse than the doctors. Besides young Fenwick
talks&mdash;tells his wife things&mdash;and she tells her
sister. And what Mary Bowden knows, the town
knows. Did I ever tell you how I found out? I
suspected, but I wanted to be sure. So I sent for
young Fenwick, and told him I wanted to make
my will. So far, so good. I made it&mdash;or he did.
And I left a couple of thousand pounds to Bessie
Fenwick and a couple more to her sister Mary in
memory of my old friendship with their father.
And as soon as Master Fenwick had gone I put
his morning&rsquo;s work in the fire. Now how do I
know he talked? This way. A week later I met
Mary Bowden in the High Street, and I had the
fright of my life. I declare I thought she&rsquo;d ha&rsquo;
kissed me. It was &lsquo;I hope you are prudent to be
out in this east wind, dear Mr. Mottisfont,&rsquo; and
I must come and see them soon&mdash;and oh, Lord,
what fools women are! Mary Bowden never
could abide me till she thought I&rsquo;d left her two
thousand pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fenwicks aren&rsquo;t the only lawyers in the
world,&rdquo; suggested David.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>&ldquo;Much obliged, I&rsquo;m sure. I did go to one
once to make a will&mdash;they say it&rsquo;s sweet to play
the fool sometimes&mdash;eh, David? Fool I was sure
enough. I found a little mottled man, that sat
blinking at me, and repeating my words, till I
could have murdered him with his own office pen-knife.
He called me Moral too, in stead of Morell.
&lsquo;Edward Moral Mottisfont,&rsquo; and I took occasion
to inform him that I wasn&rsquo;t moral, never had been
moral, and never intended to be moral. I said
he must be thinking of my nephew Edward, who
was damn moral. Oh, Lord, here <i>is</i> Edward.
I could ha&rsquo; done without him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door opened as he was speaking, and young
Edward Mottisfont came in. He was a slight,
fair man with a well-shaped head, a straight nose,
and as much chin as a great many other people.
He wore <i>pince-nez</i> because he was short-sighted,
and high collars because he had a long neck.
Both the <i>pince-nez</i> and the collar had an intensely
irritating effect upon old Mr. Edward Mottisfont.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he hadn&rsquo;t been for ever blinking at some
bug that was just out of his sight, his eyes would
have been as good as mine, and he might just as
well keep his head in a butterfly net or a collecting
box as where he does keep it. Not that I should
have said that Edward <i>did</i> keep his head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you flurry him, sir,&rdquo; said David,
&ldquo;and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know I do,&rdquo; grinned Mr. Mottisfont.</p>
<p>Young Edward Mottisfont came into the room
and shut the door.</p>
<p>Old Mr. Mottisfont watched him with black,
malicious eyes.</p>
<p>For as many years as Edward could remember
anything, he could remember just that look upon
his uncle&rsquo;s face. It made him uneasy now, as it
had made him uneasy when he was only five years
old.</p>
<p>Once when he was fifteen he said to David
Blake: &ldquo;You cheek him, David, and he likes you
for it. How on earth do you manage it? Doesn&rsquo;t
he make you feel beastly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And David stared and said: &ldquo;Beastly? Rats!
Why should I feel beastly? He&rsquo;s jolly amusing.
He makes me laugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At thirty, Edward no longer employed quite
the same ingenuous slang, but there was no doubt
that he still experienced the same sensations,
which fifteen years earlier he had characterised
as beastly.</p>
<p>Old Mr. Edward Mottisfont lay in bed with
his hands folded on his chest. He watched his
nephew with considerable amusement, and waited
for him to speak.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>Edward took a chair beside the bed. Then he
said that it was a fine day, and old Mr. Mottisfont
nodded twice with much solemnity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Edward,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you are feeling pretty well,&rdquo; was the unfortunate
Edward&rsquo;s next attempt at conversation.</p>
<p>Old Mr. Edward Mottisfont looked across at
David Blake. &ldquo;Am I feeling pretty well&mdash;eh,
David?&rdquo;</p>
<p>David laughed. He had moved when Edward
came into the room, and was standing by the
window looking out. A little square pane was
open. Through it came the drowsy murmur of
a drowsy, old-fashioned town. Mr. Mottisfont&rsquo;s
house stood a few yards back from the road, just
at the head of the High Street. Market Harford
was a very old town, and the house was a very old
house. There was a staircase which was admired
by American visitors, and a front door for which
they occasionally made bids. From where Mr.
Mottisfont lay in bed he could see a narrow lane
hedged in by high old houses with red tiles.
Beyond, the ground fell sharply away, and there
was a prospect of many red roofs. Farther still,
beyond the river, he could see the great black
chimneys of his foundry, and the smoke that came
from them. It was the sight that he loved best
in the world. David looked down into the High
Street and watched one lamp after another spring
into brightness. He could see a long ribbon of
light go down to the river and then rise again.
He turned back into the room when he was appealed
to, and said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you know best how you feel, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said old Mr. Mottisfont in a smooth,
resigned voice. &ldquo;Oh, no, David. In a private
and unofficial sort of way, yes; but in a public
and official sense, oh, dear, no. Edward wants to
know when to order his mourning, and how to
arrange his holiday so as not to clash with my
funeral, so it is for my medical adviser to reply,
ain&rsquo;t it, Edward?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The colour ran to the roots of Edward Mottisfont&rsquo;s
fair hair. He cast an appealing glance in
David&rsquo;s direction, and did not speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think any of us will order our mourning
till you&rsquo;re dead, sir,&rdquo; said David with a chuckle.
He commiserated Edward, but, after all, Edward
was a lucky dog&mdash;and to see one&rsquo;s successful rival
at a disadvantage is not an altogether unpleasant
experience. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll outlive some of us young
ones yet,&rdquo; he added, but old Mr. Mottisfont was
frowning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>&ldquo;Seen any more of young Stevenson, Edward?&rdquo;
he said, with an abrupt change of manner.</p>
<p>Edward shook his head rather ruefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, I haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, and you ain&rsquo;t likely to,&rdquo; said old Mr.
Mottisfont. &ldquo;There, you&rsquo;d best be gone. I&rsquo;ve
talked enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then good-night, sir,&rdquo; said Edward Mottisfont,
getting up with some show of cheerfulness.</p>
<p>The tone of Mr. Mottisfont&rsquo;s good-night was not
nearly such a pleasant one, and as soon as the
door had closed upon Edward he flung round
towards David Blake with an angry &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
the good of him? What&rsquo;s the good of the fellow?
He&rsquo;s not a business man. He&rsquo;s not a man at all;
he&rsquo;s an entomologiac&mdash;a lepidoptofool&mdash;a damn
lepidoptofool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These remarkable epithets followed one another
with an extraordinary rapidity.</p>
<p>When the old gentleman paused for breath
David inquired, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s muddled the new contract with
Stevenson. Thinking of butterflies, I expect.
Pretty things, butterflies&mdash;but there&mdash;I don&rsquo;t see
that I need distress myself. It ain&rsquo;t me it&rsquo;s
going to touch. It&rsquo;s Edward&rsquo;s own look-out.
My income ain&rsquo;t going to concern me for very
much longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was silent for a moment. Then he made a
restless movement with his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t, will it&mdash;eh, David? You didn&rsquo;t
mean what you said just now? It was just a
flam? I ain&rsquo;t going to live, am I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>David hesitated and the old man broke in with
an extraordinary energy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, for the Lord&rsquo;s sake, David, I&rsquo;m not a
girl&mdash;out with it! How long d&rsquo; ye give me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>David sat down on the bed again. His movements
had a surprising gentleness for so large a
man. His odd, humorous face was quite serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, sir, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I really
don&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;s no more to be done if you won&rsquo;t
let me operate. No, we won&rsquo;t go over all that
again. I know you&rsquo;ve made up your mind. And
no one can possibly say how long it may be. You
might have died this week, or you may die in a
month, or it may go on for a year&mdash;or two&mdash;or
three. You&rsquo;ve the sort of constitution they
don&rsquo;t make nowadays.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>&ldquo;Three years,&rdquo; said old Mr. Edward Mottisfont&mdash;&ldquo;three
years, David&mdash;and this damn pain
all along&mdash;all the time&mdash;gettin&rsquo; worse&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I think we can relieve the pain, sir,&rdquo; said
David cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much obliged, David. Some beastly drug
that&rsquo;ll turn me into an idiot. No, thank ye, I&rsquo;ll
keep my wits if it&rsquo;s all the same to you. Well,
well, it&rsquo;s all in the day&rsquo;s work, and I&rsquo;m not complaining,
but Edward&rsquo;ll get mortal tired of waiting
for my shoes if I last three years. I doubt his
patience holding out. He&rsquo;ll be bound to hasten
matters on. Think of the bad example I shall
be for the baby&mdash;when it comes. Lord, David,
what d&rsquo; ye want to look like that for? I suppose
they&rsquo;ll have babies like other folk, and I&rsquo;ll be a
bad example for &rsquo;em. Edward&rsquo;ll think of that.
When he&rsquo;s thought of it enough, and I&rsquo;ve got
on his nerves a bit more than usual, he&rsquo;ll
put strychnine or arsenic into my soup. Oh,
Edward&rsquo;ll poison me yet. You&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor old Edward, it&rsquo;s not much in his line,&rdquo;
said David with half a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh? What about Pellico&rsquo;s dog then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pellico&rsquo;s dog, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>&ldquo;What an innocent young man you are, David&mdash;never
heard of Pellico&rsquo;s dog before, did you?
Pellico&rsquo;s dog that got on Edward&rsquo;s nerves same as
I get on his nerves, and you never knew that
Edward dosed the poor brute with some of his
bug-curing stuff, eh? To be sure you didn&rsquo;t
think I knew, nor did Edward. I don&rsquo;t tell
everything I know, and how I know it is my affair
and none of yours, Master David Blake, but you
see Edward&rsquo;s not so unhandy with a little job in
the poisoning line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David&rsquo;s face darkened. The incident of Pellico&rsquo;s
dog had occurred when he and Edward were
schoolboys of fifteen. He remembered it very
well, but he did not very much care being reminded
of it. Every day of his life he passed the narrow
turning, down which, in defiance of parental
prohibitions, he and Edward used to race each
other to school. Old Pellico&rsquo;s dirty, evil-smelling
shop still jutted out of the farther end, and the
grimy door-step upon which his dog used to lie
in wait for their ankles was still as grimy as ever.
Sometimes it was a trouser-leg that suffered.
Sometimes an ankle was nipped, and if Pellico&rsquo;s
dog occasionally got a kick in return, it was not
more than his due. David remembered his own
surprise when it first dawned upon him that
Edward minded&mdash;yes, actually minded these encounters.
He recalled the occasion when Edward,
his face of a suspicious pallor, had denied angrily
that he was afraid of any beastly dog, and then
his sudden wincing confession that he did mind&mdash;that
he minded horribly&mdash;not because he was
afraid of being bitten&mdash;Edward explained this
point very carefully&mdash;but because the dog made
such a beastly row, and because Edward dreamed
of him at night, only in his dreams, Pellico&rsquo;s dog
was rather larger than Pellico himself, and the
lane was a cul-de-sac with a wall at the end of it,
against which he crouched in his dream whilst the
dog came nearer and nearer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;What rot,&rdquo; was David&rsquo;s comment, &ldquo;but if I
felt like that, I jolly well know I&rsquo;d knock the
brute on the head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you?&rdquo; said Edward, and that was all
that had passed. Only, when a week later Pellico&rsquo;s
dog was poisoned, David was filled with righteous
indignation. He stormed at Edward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did it&mdash;you know you did it. You did it
with some of that beastly bug-killing stuff that
you keep knocking about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edward was pale, but there was an odd
gleam of triumph in the eyes that met
David&rsquo;s.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you said you&rsquo;d do for him&mdash;you said it
yourself. So then I just did it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David stared at him with all a schoolboy&rsquo;s
crude condemnation of something that was &ldquo;not
the game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have knocked him on the head under old
Pellico&rsquo;s nose&mdash;but poison&mdash;poison&rsquo;s <i>beastly</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not reason about it. It was just instinct.
You knocked on the head a brute that annoyed
you, but you didn&rsquo;t use poison. And Edward
had used poison. That was the beginning of
David&rsquo;s great intimacy with Elizabeth Chantrey.
He did not quarrel with Edward, but they drifted
out of an inseparable friendship into a relationship
of the cool, go-as-you-please order. The
thing rankled a little after all these years. David
sat there frowning and remembering. Old Mr.
Mottisfont laughed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;Aha, you see I know most things,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;Edward&rsquo;ll poison me yet. You see, he&rsquo;s in a
fix. He hankers after this house same as I always
hankered after it. It&rsquo;s about the only taste we
have in common. He&rsquo;s got his own house on a
seven years&rsquo; lease, and here&rsquo;s Nick Anderson
going to be married, and willing to take it off his
hands. And what&rsquo;s Edward to do? It&rsquo;s a
terrible anxiety for him not knowing if I&rsquo;m going
to die or not. If he doesn&rsquo;t accept Nick&rsquo;s offer
and I die, he&rsquo;ll have two houses on his hands. If
he accepts it and I don&rsquo;t die, he&rsquo;ll not have a
house at all. It&rsquo;s a sad dilemma for Edward.
That&rsquo;s why he would enjoy seeing about my
funeral so much. He&rsquo;d do it all very handsomely.
Edward likes things handsome. And Mary, who
doesn&rsquo;t care a jot for me, will wear a black dress
that don&rsquo;t suit her, and feel like a Christian
martyr. And Elizabeth won&rsquo;t wear black at all,
though she cares a good many jots, and though
she&rsquo;d look a deal better in it than Mary&mdash;eh,
David?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But David Blake was exclaiming at the lateness
of the hour, and saying good-night, all in a breath.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER II</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">DAVID BLAKE</span></h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Grey, grey mist</p>
<p class="t">Over the old grey town,</p>
<p class="t0">A mist of years, a mist of tears,</p>

<p class="t0">And the ghosts they whisper thus, and thus,</p>
<p class="t0">Of the days when the world went with us.</p>
</div>
<p>A minute or two later Elizabeth Chantrey
came into the room. She was a very tall
woman, with a beautiful figure. All her movements
were strong, sure, and graceful. She carried
a lighted lamp in her left hand. Mr. Mottisfont
abominated electric light and refused obstinately
to have it in the house. When Elizabeth had
closed the door and set down the lamp, she crossed
over to the window and fastened a heavy oak
shutter across it. Then she sat down by the bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said in her pleasant voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; said old Mr. Mottisfont, &ldquo;well or ill&rsquo;s
all a matter of opinion, same as religion, or the
cut of a dress.&rdquo; He shut his mouth with a snap,
and lay staring at the ceiling. Presently his eyes
wandered back to Elizabeth. She was sitting
quite still, with her hands folded. Very few busy
women ever sit still at all, but Elizabeth Chantrey,
who was a very busy woman, was also a woman of
a most reposeful presence. She could be unoccupied
without appearing idle, just as she could
be silent without appearing either stupid or
constrained. Old Edward Mottisfont looked at
her for about five minutes. Then he said suddenly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll you do when I&rsquo;m dead, Elizabeth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth made no protest, as her sister Mary
would have done. She had not been Edward
Mottisfont&rsquo;s ward since she was fourteen for
nothing. She understood him very well, and she
was perhaps the one creature whom he really
loved. She leaned her chin in her hand and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Mr. Mottisfont.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Mottisfont never took his eyes off her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Edward&rsquo;ll want to move in here as soon as
possible. What&rsquo;ll you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; repeated Elizabeth, frowning
a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you don&rsquo;t know, perhaps you&rsquo;ll
listen to reason, and do as I ask you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;If I can,&rdquo; said Elizabeth Chantrey.</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay here a year,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a year isn&rsquo;t much
to ask&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;in this house. I&rsquo;ve spoken about it to
Edward. Odd creature, Edward, but, I believe,
truthful. Said he was quite agreeable. Even
went so far as to say he was fond of you, and that
Mary would be pleased. Said you&rsquo;d too much
tact to obtrude yourself, and that of course you&rsquo;d
keep your own rooms. No, I don&rsquo;t suppose
you&rsquo;ll find it particularly pleasant, but I believe
you&rsquo;ll find it worth while. Give it a year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth started ever so slightly. One may
endure for years, and make no sign, to wince at
last in one unguarded moment. So he knew&mdash;had
always known. Again Elizabeth made no protest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A year,&rdquo; she said in a low voice, &ldquo;a year&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
given fifteen years. Isn&rsquo;t fifteen years
enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something fierce came into old Edward Mottisfont&rsquo;s
eyes. His whole face hardened. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
a damn fool,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Elizabeth laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he must be,&rdquo; and she laughed again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>The old man nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grit,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;grit. That&rsquo;s the
way&mdash;laugh, Elizabeth, laugh&mdash;and let him go
hang for a damn fool. He ain&rsquo;t worth it&mdash;no man
living&rsquo;s worth it. But give him a year all the
same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If old Mr. Mottisfont had not been irritated
with David Blake for being as he put it, a damn
fool, he would not have made the references he
had done to his nephew Edward&rsquo;s wife. They
touched David upon the raw, and old Mr. Mottisfont
was very well aware of it. As David went
out of the room and closed the door, a strange
mood came upon him. All the many memories
of this house, familiar to him from early boyhood,
all the many memories of this town of his birth
and upbringing, rose about him. It was a strange
mood, but yet not a sad one, though just beyond
it lay the black shadow which is the curse of the
Celt. David Blake came of an old Irish stock,
although he had never seen Ireland. He had the
vein of poetry&mdash;the vein of sadness, which are
born at a birth with Irish humour and Irish wit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>As he went down the staircase, the famous
staircase with its carved newels, the light of a
moving lamp came up from below, and at the turn
of the stair he stood aside to let Elizabeth Chantrey
pass. She wore a grey dress, and the lamp-light
shone upon her hair and made it look like very
pale gold. It was thick hair&mdash;very fine and thick,
and she wore it in a great plait like a crown. In
the daytime it was not golden at all, but just the
colour of the pale thick honey with which wax is
mingled. Long ago a Chantrey had married a
wife from Norway with Elizabeth&rsquo;s hair and
Elizabeth&rsquo;s dark grey eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night, David,&rdquo; said Elizabeth Chantrey.
She would have passed on, but to her surprise
David made no movement. He was looking at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is where I first saw you, Elizabeth,&rdquo;
he said in a remembering voice. &ldquo;You had on a
grey dress, like that one, but Mary was in blue,
because Mr. Mottisfont wouldn&rsquo;t let her wear
mourning. Do you remember how shocked poor
Miss Agatha was?&mdash;&lsquo;and their mother only dead
a month!&rsquo; I can hear her now.&rdquo; Mary&mdash;yes, he
remembered little Mary Chantrey in her blue
dress. He could see her now&mdash;nine years old&mdash;in
a blue dress&mdash;with dark curling hair and round
brown eyes, holding tightly to Elizabeth&rsquo;s skirts,
and much too shy to speak to the big strange boy
who was Edward&rsquo;s friend.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>Elizabeth watched him. She knew very well
that he was not thinking of her, although he had
remembered the grey dress. And yet&mdash;for five
years&mdash;it was she and not Mary to whom David
came with every mood. During those five years,
the years between fourteen and nineteen, it was
always Elizabeth and David, David and Elizabeth.
Then when David was twenty, and in his first
year at hospital, Dr. Blake died suddenly, and for
four years David came no more to Market Harford.
Mrs. Blake went to live with a sister in the north,
and David&rsquo;s vacations were spent with his mother.
For a time he wrote often&mdash;then less often&mdash;finally
only at Christmas. And the years passed.
Elizabeth&rsquo;s girlhood passed. Mary grew up.
And when David Blake had been nearly three
years qualified, and young Dr. Ellerton was
drowned out boating, David bought from Mrs.
Ellerton a share in the practice that had been his
father&rsquo;s, and brought his mother back to Market
Harford. Mrs. Blake lived only for a year, but
before she died she had seen David fall headlong
in love, not with her dear Elizabeth, but with
Mary&mdash;pretty little Mary&mdash;who was turning the
heads of all the young men, sending Jimmy Larkin
with a temporarily broken heart to India, Jack
Webster with a much more seriously injured one
to the West Coast of Africa, and enjoying herself
mightily the while. Elizabeth had memories as
well as David. They came at least as near sadness
as his. She thought she had remembered
quite enough for one evening, and she set her foot
on the stair above the landing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Miss Agatha!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What a worry
we were to her, and how she disliked our coming
here. I can remember her grumbling to Mr.
Mottisfont, and saying, &lsquo;Children make such a
work in the house,&rsquo; and Mr. Mottisfont&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Mottisfont said, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be such a damn
old maid, Agatha. For the Lord&rsquo;s sake, what&rsquo;s
the good of a woman that can&rsquo;t mind children?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>David laughed too. He remembered Miss
Agatha&rsquo;s fussy indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night, David,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, and she
passed on up the wide, shallow stair.</p>
<p>The light went with her. From below there
came only a glimmer, for the lamp in the hall was
still turned low. David went slowly on. As he
was about to open the front door, Edward Mottisfont
came out of the dining-room on the left.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;One minute, David,&rdquo; he said, and took him
by the arm. &ldquo;Look here&mdash;I think I ought to
know. Is my uncle likely to live on indefinitely?
Did you mean what you said upstairs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the second time that David Blake had
been asked if he meant those words. He answered
a trifle irritably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I say what I don&rsquo;t mean? He may
live three years or he may die to-morrow. Why
on earth should I say it if I didn&rsquo;t think it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Edward. &ldquo;You
might have been saying it just to cheer the old
man up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a certain serious simplicity about
Edward Mottisfont. It was this quality in him
which his uncle stigmatised as priggishness. Your
true prig is always self-conscious, but Edward was
not at all self-conscious. From his own point of
view he saw things quite clearly. It was other
people&rsquo;s points of view which had a confusing
effect upon him. David laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t exactly cheer him up,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t as set on living as all that comes to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edward appeared to be rather struck by this
statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>He opened the door as he spoke, but suddenly
closed it again. His tone altered. It became
eager and boyish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;David, I <i>say</i>&mdash;you know Jimmy Larkin was
transferred to Assam some months ago? Well, I
wrote and asked him to remember me if he came
across anything like specimens. Of course his
forest work gives him simply priceless opportunities.
He wrote back and said he would see
what he could do, and last mail he sent me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;a package of live scorpions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;not specimens&mdash;oh, if he could only have
sent the specimen&mdash;but it was the next best thing&mdash;a
drawing&mdash;you remember how awfully well
Jimmy drew&mdash;a coloured drawing of a perfectly
new slug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edward&rsquo;s tone became absolutely ecstatic. He
began to rumple up his fair hair, as he always did
when he was excited. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t find it in any of
the books,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and they&rsquo;d never even
heard of it at the Natural History Museum. Five
yellow bands on a black ground&mdash;what do you
think of that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;I should say it was Jimmy, larking,&rdquo; murmured
David, getting the door open and departing
hastily, but Edward was a great deal too busy
wondering whether the slug ought in justice to be
called after Jimmy, or whether he might name it
after himself, to notice this ribaldry.</p>
<p>David Blake came out into a clear September
night. The sky was cloudless and the air was
still. Presently there would be a moon. David
walked down the brightly-lighted High Street, with
its familiar shops. Here and there were a few
new names, but for the most part he had known
them all from childhood. Half-way down the hill
he passed the tall grey house which had once had
his father&rsquo;s plate upon the door&mdash;the house where
David was born. Old Mr. Bull lived there now,
his father&rsquo;s partner once, retired these eighteen
months in favour of his nephew, Tom Skeffington.
All Market Harford wondered what Dr. Bull
could possibly want with a house so much too
large for him. He used only half the rooms, and
the house had a sadly neglected air, but there were
days, and this was one of them, when David,
passing, could have sworn that the house had not
changed hands at all and that the blind of his
mother&rsquo;s room was lifted a little as he went by.
She used to wave to him from that window as he
came from school. She wore the diamond ring
which David kept locked up in his despatch-box.
Sometimes it caught the light and flashed. David
could have sworn that he saw it flash to-night.
But the house was all dark and silent. The old
days were gone. David walked on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>At the bottom of the High Street, just before
you come to the bridge, he turned up to the right,
where a paved path with four stone posts across
the entrance came into the High Street at right
angles. The path ran along above the river, with
a low stone wall to the left, and a row of grey stone
houses to the right. Between the wall and the
river there were trees, which made a pleasant
shade in the summer. Now they were losing
their leaves. David opened the door of the
seventh house with his latch-key, and went in.
That night he dreamed his dream. It was a long
time now since he had dreamed it, but it was an
old dream&mdash;one that recurred from time to time&mdash;one
that had come to him at intervals for as
long as he could remember. And it was always
the same&mdash;through all the years it never varied&mdash;it
was always just the same.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>He dreamed that he was standing upon the
seashore. It was a wide, low shore, with a long,
long stretch of sand that shone like silver under a
silver moon. It shone because it was wet, still
quite wet from the touch of the tide. The tide
was very low. David stood on the shore, and saw
the moon go down into the sea. As it went down
it changed slowly. It became golden, and the
sand turned golden too. A wind began to blow
in from the sea. A wind from the west&mdash;a wind
that was strong, and yet very gentle. At the
edge of the sea there stood a woman, with long
floating hair and a long floating dress. She stood
between David and the golden moon, and the
wind blew out her dress and her long floating hair.
But David never saw her face. Always he longed
to see her face, but he never saw it. He stood
upon the shore and could not move to go to her.
When he was a boy he used to walk in his sleep
in the nights when he had this dream. Once he
was awakened by the touch of cold stones under
his bare feet. And there he stood, just as he had
come from bed, on the wet door-step, with the
front door open behind him. After that he locked
his door. Now he walked in his sleep no longer,
and it was more than a year since he had dreamed
the dream at all, but to-night it came to him again.</p>

<p class="t">With never a penny to choose,</p>
<p class="t0">But the weariest game in all the world</p>
<p class="t">Is waiting for dead men&rsquo;s shoes.</p>
</div>
<p>It was about a week later that Edward Mottisfont
rang David Blake up on the telephone
and begged him in agitated accents, to come to
Mr. Mottisfont without delay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s another attack&mdash;a very bad one,&rdquo; said
Edward in the hall. His voice shook a little, and
he seemed very nervous. David thought it was
certainly a bad attack. He also thought it a
strange one. The old man was in great pain, and
very ill. Elizabeth Chantrey was in the room,
but after a glance at his patient, David sent her
away. As she went she made a movement to
take up an empty cup which stood on the small
table beside the bed, and old Mr. Edward Mottisfont
fairly snapped at her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;Leave it, will you&mdash;I&rsquo;ve stopped Edward
taking it twice. Leave it, I say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth went out without a word, and Mr.
Mottisfont caught David&rsquo;s wrist in a shaky grip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo; you know why I wouldn&rsquo;t let her take that
cup? D&rsquo; you know why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Mr. Mottisfont&rsquo;s voice dropped to a thread.
He was panting a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was all right till I drank that damned tea,
David,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and Edward brought it to me&mdash;Edward&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, sir&mdash;come&mdash;&rdquo; said David gently. He
was really fond of this queer old man, and he was
distressed for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;David, you won&rsquo;t let him give me things&mdash;you&rsquo;ll
look to it. Look in the cup. I wouldn&rsquo;t
let &rsquo;em take the cup&mdash;there&rsquo;s dregs. Look at
&rsquo;em, David.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>David took up the cup and walked to the window.
About a tablespoonful of cold tea remained.
David tilted the cup, then became suddenly
attentive. That small remainder of cold tea with
the little skim of cream upon it had suddenly
become of absorbing interest. David tilted the
cup still more. The tea made a little pool on one
side of it, and all across the bottom of the cup a
thick white sediment drained slowly down into
the pool. It was such a sediment as is left by very
chalky water. But all the water of Market Harford
is as soft as rain-water. It is not only chalk
that makes a sediment like that. Arsenic makes
one, too. David put down the cup quickly.
He opened the door and went out into the
passage. From the far end Elizabeth Chantrey
came to meet him, and he gave her a hastily
scribbled note for the chemist, and asked her for
one or two things that were in the house. When
he came back into Mr. Mottisfont&rsquo;s room he went
straight to the wash-stand, took up a small glass
bottle labelled ipecacuanha wine and spent two or
three minutes in washing it thoroughly. Then he
poured into it very carefully the contents of the
cup. He did all this in total silence, and in a very
quiet and business-like manner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>Old Mr. Edward Mottisfont lay on his right
side and watched him. His face was twisted with
pain, and there was a dampness upon his brow,
but his eyes followed every motion that David
made and noted every look upon his face. They
were intent&mdash;alive&mdash;observant. Whilst David
stood by the wash-stand, with his back towards
the bed, old Mr. Edward Mottisfont&rsquo;s lips twisted
themselves into an odd smile. A gleam of sardonic
humour danced for a moment in the watching
eyes. When David put down the bottle and
came over to the bed, the gleam was gone, and
there was only pain&mdash;great pain&mdash;in the old,
restless face. There was a knock at the door, and
Elizabeth Chantrey came in.</p>
<p>Three hours later David Blake came out of the
room that faced old Mr. Mottisfont&rsquo;s at the farther
end of the corridor. It was a long, low room, fitted
up as a laboratory&mdash;very well and fully fitted up&mdash;for
the old man had for years found his greatest
pleasure and relaxation in experimenting with
chemicals. Some of his experiments he confided
to David, but the majority he kept carefully to
himself. They were of a somewhat curious nature.
David Blake came out of the laboratory with a
very stern look upon his face. As he went down
the stair he met with Edward Mottisfont coming
up. The sternness intensified. Edward looked
an unspoken question, and then without a word
turned and went down before David into the hall.
Then he waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone?&rdquo; he said in a sort of whisper, and David
bent his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>He was remembering that it was only a week
since he had told Edward in this very spot that his
uncle might live for three years. Well, he was
dead now. The old man was dead now&mdash;out of
the way&mdash;some one had seen to that. Who?
David could still hear Edward Mottisfont&rsquo;s voice
asking, &ldquo;How long is he likely to live?&rdquo; and his
own answer, &ldquo;Perhaps three years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in here,&rdquo; said Edward Mottisfont. He
opened the dining-room door as he spoke, and
David followed him into a dark, old-fashioned
room, separated from the one behind it by folding-doors.
One of the doors stood open about an
inch, but there was only one lamp in the room, and
neither of the two men paid any attention to such
a trifling circumstance.</p>
<p>Edward sat down by the table, which was laid
for dinner. Even above the white tablecloth his
face was noticeably white. All his life this old
man had been his bugbear. He had hated him,
not with the hot hatred which springs from one
great sudden wrong, but with the cold slow abhorrence
bred of a thousand trifling oppressions.
He had looked forward to his death. For years he
had thought to himself, &ldquo;Well, he can&rsquo;t live for
ever.&rdquo; But now that the old man was dead, and
the yoke lifted from his neck, he felt no relief&mdash;no
sense of freedom. He felt oddly shocked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>David Blake did not sit down. He stood at the
opposite side of the table and looked at Edward.
From where he stood he could see first the
white tablecloth, then Edward&rsquo;s face, and on
the wall behind Edward, a full-length portrait
of old Edward Mottisfont at the age of thirty.
It was the work of a young man whom Market
Harford had looked upon as a very disreputable
young man. He had since become so famous that
they had affixed a tablet to the front of the house
in which he had once lived. The portrait was one
of the best he had ever painted, and the eyes,
Edward Mottisfont&rsquo;s black, malicious eyes, looked
down from the wall at his nephew, and at David
Blake. Neither of the men had spoken since they
entered the room, but they were both so busy with
their thoughts that neither noticed how silent the
other was.</p>
<p>At last David spoke. He said in a hard level
voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Edward, I can&rsquo;t sign the certificate. There
will have to be an inquest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edward Mottisfont looked up with a great start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An inquest?&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;an inquest?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>One of David&rsquo;s hands rested on the table. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t sign the certificate,&rdquo; he repeated.</p>
<p>Edward stared at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said David Blake.</p>
<p>Edward rumpled up his hair in a distracted
fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;An inquest?
Why, you&rsquo;ve been attending him all these
months, and you said he might die at any time.
You said it only the other day. I don&rsquo;t understand&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor do I,&rdquo; said David curtly.</p>
<p>Edward stared again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Mottisfont might have lived for some
time,&rdquo; said David Blake, speaking slowly. &ldquo;I was
attending him for a chronic illness, which would
have killed him sooner or later. But it didn&rsquo;t
kill him. It didn&rsquo;t have a chance. He died of
poisoning&mdash;arsenic poisoning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of Edward&rsquo;s hands was lying on the table.
His whole arm twitched, and the hand fell over,
palm upwards. The fingers opened and closed
slowly. David found himself staring at that
slowly moving hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; said Edward, and his breath
caught in his throat as he said it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edward leaned forward a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, David,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not possible.
Who&mdash;who do you think&mdash;who would do such a
thing? Or&mdash;suicide&mdash;do you think he committed
suicide?&rdquo;</p>
<p>David drew himself suddenly away from the
table. All at once the feeling had come to him
that he could no longer touch what Edward
touched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think it was suicide,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;But of course it&rsquo;s not my business to think at
all. I shall give my evidence, and there, as far
as I am concerned, the matter ends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edward looked helplessly at David.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evidence?&rdquo; he repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the inquest,&rdquo; said David Blake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said Edward again.
He put his head in his hands, and seemed to be
thinking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see
how&mdash;it was an attack&mdash;just like his other attacks&mdash;and
then he died&mdash;you always said he might
die in one of those attacks.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>There was a sort of trembling eagerness in
Edward&rsquo;s tone. A feeling of nausea swept over
David. The scene had become intolerable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Mottisfont died because he drank a cup
of tea which contained enough arsenic to kill a
man in robust health,&rdquo; he said sharply.</p>
<p>He looked once at Edward, saw him start, and
added, &ldquo;and I think that you brought him that
tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Edward. &ldquo;He asked me for it,
how could there be arsenic in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was,&rdquo; said David Blake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arsenic? But I brought him the tea&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you brought him the tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edward lifted his head. His eyes behind his
glasses had a misty and bewildered look. His
voice shook a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;if there&rsquo;s an inquest&mdash;they might say&mdash;they
might think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pushed his chair back a little way, and half
rose from it, resting his hands on the table, and
peering across it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;David, why do you look at me like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>David Blake turned away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s none of my business,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
got to give my evidence, and for God&rsquo;s sake,
Edward, pull yourself together before the inquest,
and get decent legal advice, for you&rsquo;ll need it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edward was shockingly pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;what do you mean? That people
will think&mdash;it&rsquo;s impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David went towards the door. His face was
like a flint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean this,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Mr. Mottisfont died
of arsenic poisoning. The arsenic was in a cup
of tea which he drank. You brought him the
tea. You are undoubtedly in a very serious position.
There will have to be an inquest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edward had risen completely. He made a
step towards David.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if you were to sign the certificate&mdash;there
wouldn&rsquo;t need to be an inquest&mdash;David&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m damned if I&rsquo;ll sign the certificate,&rdquo;
said David Blake.</p>
<p>He went out and shut the door sharply behind
him.</p>

<p class="t0">&ldquo;And what will you give me instead?</p>
<p class="t0">Will you give me your honour?&rdquo; she said.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Elizabeth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elizabeth&mdash;open your door!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth Chantrey came back from a long way
off. Mary was calling her. Mary was knocking
at her door. She got up rather wearily, turned
the key, and with a little gasp, Mary was in the
room, shutting the door, and standing with her
back against it. The lamp burned low, but
Elizabeth&rsquo;s eyes were accustomed to the gloom.
Mary Mottisfont&rsquo;s bright, clear colour was one of
her great attractions. It was all gone and her
dark eyes looked darker and larger than they
should have done.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Molly, I thought you had gone home.
Edward told me he was sending you home an
hour ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told me to go,&rdquo; said Mary in a sort of
stumbling whisper. &ldquo;He told me to go&mdash;but I
wanted to wait and go with him. I knew he&rsquo;d
be upset&mdash;I knew he&rsquo;d feel it&mdash;when it was all
over. I wanted to be with him&mdash;oh, Liz&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary, what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary put up a shaking hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you&mdash;don&rsquo;t stop me&mdash;there&rsquo;s no time&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
tell you&mdash;oh, I&rsquo;m telling you as fast as I
can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke in a series of gasps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went into your little room behind the dining-room.
I knew no one would come. I knew I
should hear any one coming or going. I opened
the door into the dining-room&mdash;just a little&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary, what <i>is</i> it?&rdquo; said Elizabeth. She put
her arm round her sister, but Mary pushed her
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;there&rsquo;s no time. Let me go on.
David came down. He came into the dining-room.
He talked to Edward. He said, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t
sign the certificate,&rsquo; and Edward said, &lsquo;Why not?&rsquo;
and David said, &lsquo;Because&rsquo;&mdash;Liz&mdash;I can&rsquo;t&mdash;oh,
Liz, I can&rsquo;t&mdash;I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>Mary caught suddenly at Elizabeth&rsquo;s arm and
began to sob. She had no tears&mdash;only hard sobs.
Her pretty oval face was all white and drawn.
There were dark marks like bruises under her
hazel eyes. The little dark rings of hair about
her forehead were damp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dearest&mdash;darling&mdash;my Molly dear,&rdquo; said
Elizabeth. She held Mary to her, with strong
supporting arms, but the shuddering sobs went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Liz&mdash;it was poison. He says it was poison.
He says there was poison in the tea&mdash;arsenic
poison&mdash;and Edward took him the tea. Liz&mdash;Liz,
why do such awful things happen? Why does
God let them happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth was much taller than her sister&mdash;taller
and stronger. She released herself from
the clutching fingers, and let both her hands fall
suddenly and heavily upon Mary&rsquo;s shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Molly, what are you talking about?&rdquo; she
cried.</p>
<p>Mary was startled into a momentary self-control.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Mottisfont,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;David said it
was poison&mdash;poison, Liz.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>Her voice fell to a low horrified whisper at the
word, and then rose on the old gasp of, &ldquo;Edward
took him the tea.&rdquo; A numbness came upon
Elizabeth. Feeling was paralysed. She was
conscious neither of horror, anxiety, nor sorrow.
Only her brain remained clear. All her consciousness
seemed to have gone to it, and it worked with
an inconceivable clearness and rapidity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, Mary,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What are you
saying? Edward&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary pushed her away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Liz, if you dared&mdash;but
you don&rsquo;t&mdash;no one could really&mdash;Edward of
all people. But there&rsquo;s all the talk, the scandal&mdash;we
can&rsquo;t have it. It must be stopped. And we&rsquo;re
losing time, we&rsquo;re losing time dreadfully. I must
go to David, and stop him before he writes to
any one, or sees any one. He must sign the
certificate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth stood quite still for a moment. Then
she went to the wash-stand, poured out a glass of
water, and came back to Mary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drink this, Molly,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Yes, drink
it all, and pull yourself together. Now listen to
me. You can&rsquo;t possibly go to David.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go, I must,&rdquo; said Mary. Her tone
hardened. &ldquo;Will you come with me, Liz, or
must I go alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth took the empty glass and set it down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>&ldquo;Molly, my dear, you must listen. No&mdash;I&rsquo;m
thinking of what&rsquo;s best for every one. You
don&rsquo;t want any talk. If you go to David&rsquo;s house
at this hour&mdash;well, you can see for yourself. No&mdash;listen,
my dear. If I ring David up, and ask
him to come here at once&mdash;at <i>once</i>&mdash;to see me,
don&rsquo;t you see how much better that will be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary&rsquo;s colour came and went. She stood
irresolute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she said at last. &ldquo;If he&rsquo;ll come.
If he won&rsquo;t, then I&rsquo;ll go to him, and I don&rsquo;t care
what you say, Elizabeth&mdash;and you must be quick&mdash;quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went downstairs in silence. Mr. Mottisfont&rsquo;s
study was in darkness, and Elizabeth
brought in the lamp from the hall, holding it very
steadily. Then she sat down at the great littered
desk and rang up the exchange. She gave the
number and they waited. After what seemed like
a very long time, Elizabeth heard David&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is I&mdash;Elizabeth,&rdquo; said Elizabeth Chantrey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you come here at once? I want to see
you at once. Yes, it is very important&mdash;important
and urgent.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>Mary was in an agony of impatience. &ldquo;What
does he say? Will he come? Will he come at
once?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Elizabeth answered David and not her
sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, presently won&rsquo;t do. It must be at once.
It&rsquo;s really urgent, David, or I wouldn&rsquo;t ask it.
Yes, thank you so much. In my room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She put down the receiver, rang off, and turned
to Mary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is coming. Had you not better send
Edward a message, or he will be coming back
here? Ring up, and say that you are staying
with me for an hour, and that Markham will
walk home with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Elizabeth&rsquo;s little brown room the silence
weighed and the time lagged. Mary walked up
and down, moving perpetually&mdash;restlessly&mdash;uselessly.
There was a small Dutch mirror above the
writing-table. Its cut glass border caught the
light, and reflected it in diamond points and rainbow
flashes. It was the brightest thing in the
room. Mary stood for a moment and looked at
her own face. She began to arrange her hair with
nervous, trembling fingers. She rubbed her
cheeks, and straightened the lace at her
throat. Then she fell to pacing up and down
again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;The room&rsquo;s so hot,&rdquo; she said suddenly. And
she went quickly to the window and flung it open.
The air came in, cold and mournfully damp.
Mary drew half a dozen long breaths. Then she
shivered, her teeth chattered. She shut the
window with a jerk, and as she did so David Blake
came into the room. It was Elizabeth he saw,
and it was to Elizabeth that he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is anything the matter? Anything fresh?&rdquo;
Elizabeth moved aside, and all at once he saw
Mary Mottisfont.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary wants to speak to you,&rdquo; said Elizabeth.
She made a step towards the door, but Mary
called her sharply. &ldquo;No, Liz&mdash;stay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Elizabeth drew back into the shadowed
corner by the window, whilst Mary came forward
into the light. For a moment there was silence.
Mary&rsquo;s hands were clasped before her, her chin
was a little lifted, her eyes were desperately
intent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;David,&rdquo; she said in a low fluttering voice,
&ldquo;oh, David&mdash;I was in here&mdash;I heard&mdash;I could not
help hearing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>&ldquo;What did you hear?&rdquo; asked David Blake.
The words came from him with a sort of startled
hardness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard everything you said to Edward&mdash;about
Mr. Mottisfont. You said it was poison.
I heard you say it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said David Blake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Edward took him the tea,&rdquo; said Mary
quickly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see, David&mdash;don&rsquo;t you see
how dreadful it is for Edward? People who didn&rsquo;t
know him might say&mdash;they might think such
dreadful things&mdash;and if there were an inquest&mdash;&rdquo;
the words came in a sort of strangled whisper.
&ldquo;There can&rsquo;t be an inquest&mdash;there <i>can&rsquo;t</i>. Oh,
David, you&rsquo;ll sign the certificate, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>David&rsquo;s face had been changing while she spoke.
The first hard startled look went from it. It was
succeeded by a flash of something like horror, and
then by pain&mdash;pain and a great pity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mary, dear, I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said very gently.
He looked at her, and further words died upon his
lips. Mary came nearer. There was a big chair
in front of the fireplace, and she rested one hand
on the back of it. It seemed as if she needed
something firm to touch, her world was shifting
so. David had remained standing by the door,
but Mary was not a yard away from him now.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;You see, David,&rdquo; she said, still in that low
tremulous voice, &ldquo;you see, David, you haven&rsquo;t
thought&mdash;you can&rsquo;t have thought&mdash;what it will
mean if you don&rsquo;t. Edward might be suspected
of a most dreadful thing. I&rsquo;m sure you haven&rsquo;t
thought of that. He might even&rdquo;&mdash;Mary&rsquo;s eyes
widened&mdash;&ldquo;he might even be <i>arrested</i>&mdash;and tried&mdash;and
I couldn&rsquo;t bear it.&rdquo; The hand that rested
on the chair began to tremble very much. &ldquo;I
couldn&rsquo;t <i>bear</i> it,&rdquo; said Mary piteously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary, my dear,&rdquo; said David, &ldquo;this is a business
matter, and you mustn&rsquo;t interfere&mdash;I can&rsquo;t
possibly sign the certificate. Poor old Mr. Mottisfont
did not die a natural death, and the matter
will have to be inquired into. No innocent person
need have anything to be afraid of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Mary. Her breath came hard.
&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t told any one&mdash;not yet? You
haven&rsquo;t written? Oh, am I too late? Have you
told people already?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said David, &ldquo;not yet, but I must.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tears came with a rush to Mary&rsquo;s eyes, and
began to roll down her cheeks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, David, no,&rdquo; she said. Her left hand
went out towards him gropingly. &ldquo;Oh, no, David,
you mustn&rsquo;t. You haven&rsquo;t thought&mdash;indeed you
haven&rsquo;t. Innocent people can&rsquo;t always prove
that they are innocent. They <i>can&rsquo;t</i>. There&rsquo;s a
book&mdash;a dreadful book. I&rsquo;ve just been reading
it. There was a man who was quite, quite innocent&mdash;as
innocent as Edward&mdash;and he couldn&rsquo;t
prove it. And they were going to hang him&mdash;David!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary&rsquo;s voice broke off with a sort of jerk. Her
face became suddenly ghastly. There was an
extremity of terror in every sharpened feature.
Elizabeth stood quite straight and still by the
window. She was all in shadow, her brown dress
lost against the soft brown gloom of the half-drawn
velvet curtain. She felt like a shadow
herself as she looked and listened. The numbness
was upon her still. She was conscious as
it were of a black cloud that overshadowed them
all&mdash;herself, Mary, Edward. But not David.
David stood just beyond, and Mary was trying to
hold him and to draw him into the blackness.
Something in Elizabeth&rsquo;s deadened consciousness
kept saying over and over again: &ldquo;Not David,
not David.&rdquo; Elizabeth saw the black cloud with
a strange internal vision. With her bodily eyes
she watched David&rsquo;s face. She saw it harden
when Mary looked at him, and quiver with pain
when she looked away. She saw his hand go out
and touch Mary&rsquo;s hand, and she heard him say:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mary, I can&rsquo;t. Don&rsquo;t ask me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary put her other hand suddenly on David&rsquo;s
wrist. A bright colour flamed into her cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;David, you used to be fond of me&mdash;once&mdash;not
long ago. You said you would do anything for
me. Anything in the world. You said you loved
me. And you said that nowadays a man did not
get the opportunity of showing a woman what he
would do for her. You wanted to do something
for me then, and I had nothing to ask you. Aren&rsquo;t
you fond of me any more, David? Won&rsquo;t you do
anything for me now?&mdash;now that I ask you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>David pulled his hand roughly from her grasp.
He pushed past her, and crossed the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary, you don&rsquo;t know what you are asking
me,&rdquo; he said in a tone of sharp exasperation.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you are talking about.
You don&rsquo;t seem to realise that you are asking me
to become an accessory after the fact in a case of
murder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary shuddered. The word was like a blow.
She spoke in a hurried whispering way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;But Edward&mdash;it&rsquo;s for Edward. What will
happen to Edward? And to me? Don&rsquo;t you
care? We&rsquo;ve only been married six months.
It&rsquo;s such a little time. Don&rsquo;t you care at all? I
never knew such dreadful things could happen&mdash;not
to one&rsquo;s self. You read things in papers,
and you never think&mdash;you never, never think that
a thing like that could happen to yourself. I
suppose those people don&rsquo;t all die, but I should
die. Oh, David, aren&rsquo;t you going to help us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke the last words as a child might have
spoken them. Her eyes were fixed appealingly
upon David&rsquo;s face. Mary Mottisfont had very
beautiful eyes. They were hazel in colour, and
in shape and expression they resembled those of
another Mary, who was also Queen of Hearts.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Chantrey became suddenly aware
that she was shaking all over, and that the room
was full of a thick white mist. She groped in the
mist and found a chair. She made a step forward,
and sat down. Then the mist grew thinner by
degrees, and through it she saw that Mary had
come quite close to David again. She was looking
up at him. Her hands were against his breast,
and she was saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;David&mdash;David&mdash;David, you said the world
was not enough to give me once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David&rsquo;s face was rigid.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t take what I had to give,&rdquo; he
said very low. He had forgotten Elizabeth
Chantrey. He saw nothing but Mary&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t want my love, Mary, and now
you want my honour. And you say it is only a
little thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary lifted her head and met his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If it is a great thing,
well, I shall value it all the more. Oh, David,
because I ask it. Because I shall love you all my
life, and bless you all my life. And if I&rsquo;m asking
you a great thing&mdash;oh, David, you said that
nothing would be too great to give me. Oh,
David, won&rsquo;t you give me this now? Won&rsquo;t you
give me this one thing, because I ask it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Mary spoke the mist cleared from before
Elizabeth&rsquo;s eyes and the numbness that had been
upon her changed slowly into feeling. She put
both hands to her heart, and held them there.
Her heart beat against her hands, and every beat
hurt her. She felt again, and what she felt was
the sharpest pain that she had ever known, and
she had known much pain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>She had suffered when David left Market
Harford. She had suffered when he ceased to
write. She had suffered when he returned only
to fall headlong in love with Mary. And what
she had suffered then had been a personal pang,
a thing to be struggled with, dominated, and overcome.
Now she must look on whilst David
suffered too. Must watch whilst his nerves
tautened, his strength failed, his self-control gave
way. And she could not shut her eyes or look
away. She could not raise her thought above this
level of pain. The black cloud overshadowed
them and hid the light of heaven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I ask you, David&mdash;David, because
I ask you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary&rsquo;s voice trembled and fell to a quivering
whisper.</p>
<p>Suddenly David pushed her away. He turned
and made a stumbling step towards the fireplace.
His hands gripped the narrow mantelshelf. His
eyes stared at the wall. And from the wall
Mary&rsquo;s eyes looked back at him from the miniature
of Mary&rsquo;s mother. There was a long minute&rsquo;s
silence. Then David swung round. His face was
flushed, his eyes looked black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I do it can you hold your tongues?&rdquo; he said
in a rough, harsh voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Mary drew a deep soft breath of relief. She
had won. Her hands dropped to her side, her
whole figure relaxed, her face became soft and
young again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O David, God bless you!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>David frowned. His brows made a dark line
across his face. Every feature was heavy and
forbidding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you hold your tongues?&rdquo; he repeated.
&ldquo;Do you understand&mdash;do you fully understand
that if a word of this is ever to get out it&rsquo;s just
sheer ruin to the lot of us? Do you grasp that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth Chantrey got up. She crossed the
room, and stood at David&rsquo;s side, nearly as tall as
he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it, David,&rdquo; she said, with a sudden
passion in her voice.</p>
<p>Mary turned on her in a flash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Liz,&rdquo; she cried; but David stood between.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s none of your business, Elizabeth. You
keep out of it.&rdquo; The tone was kinder than the
words.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was silent. She drew away, and did
not speak again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it on one condition,&rdquo; said David Blake.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better go and tell Edward at once. I
don&rsquo;t want to see him. I don&rsquo;t suppose he&rsquo;s
been talking to any one&mdash;it&rsquo;s not exactly likely&mdash;but
if he has the matter&rsquo;s out of my hands. I&rsquo;ll
not touch it. If he hasn&rsquo;t, and you&rsquo;ll all hold
your tongues, I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to the door and Mary cried: &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t
you write it now? Won&rsquo;t you sign it before you
go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>David laughed grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I go about with my pockets
full of death certificates?&rdquo; he said. Then he was
gone, and the door shut to behind him.</p>
<p>Elizabeth moved, and spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell Markham that you are ready to go
home,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p class="t0">For the less there is to talk about, the more there is to say.</p>
</div>
<p>The obituary notices of old Mr. Mottisfont
which appeared in due course in the two
local papers were of a glowingly appreciative
nature, and at least as accurate as such notices
usually are. David could not help thinking how
much the old gentleman would have relished the
fine phrases and the flowing periods. Sixty years
of hard work were compressed into two and a half
columns of palpitating journalese. David preferred
the old man&rsquo;s own version, which had fewer
adjectives and a great deal more backbone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;My father left me nothing but debts&mdash;and
William. The ironworks were in a bad way, and
we were on the edge of a bankruptcy. I was
twenty-one, and William was fifteen, and every one
shook their heads. I can see &rsquo;em now. Well, I
gave some folk the rough side of my tongue, and
some the smooth. I had to have money, and no
one would lend. I got a little credit, but I couldn&rsquo;t
get the cash. Then I hunted up my father&rsquo;s
cousin, Edward Moberly. Rolling he was, and
as close as wax. Bored to death too, for all his
money. I talked to him, and he took to me. I
talked to him for three days, and he lent me what
I wanted, on my note of hand, and I paid it all
back in five years, and the interest up-to-date
right along. It took some doing but I got it
done. Then the thing got a go on it, and we
climbed right up. And folks stopped shaking
their heads. I began to make my mark. I began
to be a &lsquo;respected fellow-citizen.&rsquo; Oh, Lord,
David, if you&rsquo;d known William you&rsquo;d respect
me too! Talk about the debts&mdash;as a handicap,
they weren&rsquo;t worth mentioning in the same breath
with William. I could talk people into believing
I was solvent, but I couldn&rsquo;t talk &rsquo;em into
believing that William had any business capacity.
And I couldn&rsquo;t pay off William, same as I paid
off the debts.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>David&rsquo;s recollections plunged him suddenly
into a gulf of black depression. Such a plucky
old man, and now he was dead&mdash;out of the way&mdash;and
he, David, had lent a hand to cover the matter
over, and shield the murderer. David took the
black fit to bed with him at night, and rose in
the morning with the gloom upon him still. It
became a shadow which went with him in all his
ways, and clung about his every thought. And
with the gloom there came upon him a horrible,
haunting recurrence of his old passion for Mary.
The wound made by her rejection of him had been
slowly skinning over, but in the scene which they
had shared, and the stress of the emotions raised
by it, this wound had broken out afresh, and now
it was no more a deep clean cut, but a festering
thing that bid fair to poison all the springs of life.
At Mary&rsquo;s bidding he had violated a trust, and
his own sense of honour. There were times when
he hated Mary. There were times when he craved
for her. And always his contempt for himself
deepened, and with it the gloom&mdash;the black gloom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;The doctor gets through a sight of whisky
these days,&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Havergill, David&rsquo;s
housekeeper. &ldquo;And a more abstemious gentleman,
I&rsquo;m sure I never did live with. Weeks a
bottle of whisky &rsquo;ud last, unless he&rsquo;d friends in.
And now&mdash;gone like a flash, as you might say.
Only, just you mind there&rsquo;s not a word of this
goes out of the &rsquo;ouse, Sarah, my girl. D&rsquo; ye hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sarah, a whey-faced girl whose arms and legs
were set on at uncertain angles, only nodded.
She adored David with the unreasoning affection
of a dog, and had he taken to washing in whisky
instead of merely drinking it, she would have
regarded his doing so as quite a right and proper
thing.</p>
<p>When the local papers had finished Mr. Mottisfont&rsquo;s
obituary notices and had lavished all their
remaining stock of adjectives upon the funeral
arrangements, they proceeded to interest themselves
in the terms of his will. For once, old Mr.
Mottisfont had done very much what was expected
of him. Local charities benefited and old servants
were remembered. Elizabeth Chantrey was left
twenty-five thousand pounds, and everything else
went to Edward. &ldquo;To David Blake I leave my
sincere respect, he having declined to receive a
legacy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David could almost see the old man grin as he
wrote the words, could almost hear him chuckle,
&ldquo;Very well, my highfalutin young man&mdash;into the
pillory with you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>The situation held a touch of sardonic humour
beyond old Mr. Mottisfont&rsquo;s contriving, and the
iron of it rusted into David&rsquo;s soul. Market
Harford discussed the terms of the will with great
interest. They began to speculate as to what
Elizabeth Chantrey would do. When it transpired
that she was going to remain on in the old
house and be joined there by Edward and Mary,
there was quite a little buzz of talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assure you he made it a condition&mdash;a <i>secret</i>
condition,&rdquo; said old Mrs. Codrington in her deep
booming voice. &ldquo;I have it from Mary herself.
He made it a condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was quite impossible to disbelieve a statement
made with so much authority. Mrs. Codrington&rsquo;s
voice always stood her in good stead.
It had a solidity which served to prop up any
shaky fact. Miss Dobell, to whom she was
speaking, sniffed, and felt a little out of it. She
had been Agatha Mottisfont&rsquo;s great friend, and
as such she felt that she herself should have been
the fountainhead of information. As soon as
Mrs. Codrington had departed Miss Hester
Dobell put on her outdoor things and went to
call upon Mary Mottisfont.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>As it was a damp afternoon, she pinned up her
skirts all round, and she was still unpinning them
upon Mary&rsquo;s doorstep, when the door opened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Chantrey is with her sister? Oh, indeed!
That is very nice, very nice indeed. And Mrs.
Mottisfont is seeing visitors, you say? Yes?
Then I will just walk in&mdash;just walk in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Dobell came into the drawing-room with
a little fluttered run. Her faded blue eyes were
moist, but not so moist as to prevent her perceiving
that Mary wore a black dress which did not
become her, and that Elizabeth had on an old
grey coat and skirt, with dark furs, and a close
felt hat which almost hid her hair. She greeted
Mary very affectionately and Elizabeth a shade
less affectionately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you are well, Mary, my dear? Yes?
That is good. These sad times are very trying.
And you, Elizabeth? I am pleased to find that
you are able to be out. I feared you were indisposed.
Every one was saying, &lsquo;Miss Chantrey
must be indisposed, as she was not at the funeral.&rsquo;
And I feared it was the case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you, I am quite well,&rdquo; said Elizabeth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>Miss Dobell seated herself, smoothing down her
skirt. It was of a very bright blue, and she wore
with it a little fawn-coloured jacket adorned with
a black and white braid, which was arranged upon
it in loops and spirals. She had on also a blue
tie, fastened in a bow at her throat, and an extremely
oddly-shaped hat, from one side of which
depended a somewhat battered bunch of purple
grapes. Beneath this rather bacchanalian headgear
her old, mild, straw-coloured face had all the
effect of an anachronism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so glad to find you both. I am so glad
to have the opportunity of explaining how it was
that I did not attend the funeral. It was a great
disappointment. Everything so impressive, by
all accounts. Yes. But I could not have attended
without proper mourning. No. Oh, no, it
would have been impossible. Even though I was
aware that poor dear Mr. Mottisfont entertained
very singular ideas upon the subject of mourning,
I know how much they grieved poor dear Agatha.
They were very singular. I suppose, my dear
Elizabeth, that it is in deference to poor Mr.
Mottisfont&rsquo;s wishes that you do not wear black.
I said to every one at once&mdash;oh, at <i>once</i>&mdash;&lsquo;depend
upon it poor Mr. Mottisfont must have expressed
a <i>wish</i>. Otherwise Miss Chantrey would certainly
wear mourning&mdash;oh, certainly. After living
so long in the house, and being like a daughter to
him, it would be only proper, only right and
proper.&rsquo; That is what I said, and I am sure I was
right. It was his wish, was it not?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;He did not like to see people in black,&rdquo; said
Elizabeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Miss Dobell in a flustered little
voice. &ldquo;Very strange, is it not? But then so
many of poor Mr. Mottisfont&rsquo;s ideas were very
strange. I cannot help remembering how they
used to grieve poor dear Agatha. And his views&mdash;so
sad&mdash;so very sad. But there, we must not
speak of them now that he is dead. No. Doubtless
he knows better now. Oh, yes, we must hope
so. I do not know what made me speak of it.
I should not have done so. No, not now that he
is dead! It was not right, or charitable. But I
really only intended to explain how it came about
that I was not at the funeral. It was a great
deprivation&mdash;a very great deprivation, but I was
there in spirit&mdash;oh, yes, in spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The purple grapes nodded a little in sympathy
with Miss Dobell&rsquo;s nervous agitation. She put
up a little hand, clothed in a brown woollen glove,
and steadied them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;I often think,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that I should do
well to purchase one black garment for such occasions
as these. Now I should hardly have liked
to come here to-day, dressed in colours, had I not
been aware of poor dear Mr. Mottisfont&rsquo;s views.
It is awkward. Yes, oh, yes. But you see, my
dear Mary, in my youth, being one of a very large
family, we were so continually in mourning that I
really hardly ever possessed any garment of a
coloured nature. When I was only six years old
I can remember that we were in mourning for my
grandfather. In those days, my dears, little
girls, wore, well, they wore&mdash;little&mdash;hem&mdash;white
trousers, quite long, you know, reaching in fact to
the ankle. Under a black frock it had quite a
garish appearance. And my dear mother, who
was very particular about all family observances,
used to stitch black crape bands upon the trouser-legs.
It was quite a work. Oh, yes, I assure you.
Then after my grandfather, there was my great-uncle
George, and on the other side of the family
my great-aunt Eliza. And then there were my
uncles, and two aunts, and quite a number of
cousins. And, later on, my own dear brothers
and sisters. So that, as you may say, we were
never out of black at all, for our means were such
that it was necessary to wear out one garment
before another could be purchased. And I became
a little weary of wearing black, my dears.
So when my last dear sister died, I went into
colours. Not at once, oh, no!&rdquo;&mdash;Miss Dobell
became very much shocked and agitated at the
sound of her own words. &ldquo;Oh, dear, no. Not,
of course, until after a full and proper period of
mourning, but when that was over I went into
colours, and have never since possessed anything
black. You see, as I have no more relations, it
is unnecessary that I should be provided with
mourning.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>Elizabeth Chantrey left her sister&rsquo;s house in
rather a saddened mood. She wondered if she
too would ever be left derelict. Unmarried
women were often very lonely. Life went past
them down other channels. They missed their
link with the generations to come, and as the new
life sprang up it knew them not, and they had
neither part nor lot in it. When she reached
home she sat for a long while very still, forcing
her consciousness into a realisation of Life as
a thing unbroken, one, eternal. The peace of
it came upon her, and the sadness passed.</p>

</div>
<p>Old Mr. Mottisfont had been dead for about
a fortnight when the letter arrived. David
Blake found it upon his breakfast table when he
came downstairs. It was a Friday morning, and
there was an east wind blowing. David came into
the dining-room wishing that there were no such
thing as breakfast, and there, propped up in
front of his plate, was the letter. He stared at it,
and stared again. A series of sleepless or hag-ridden
nights are not the best preparation for a
letter written in a dead man&rsquo;s hand and sealed
with a dead man&rsquo;s seal. If David&rsquo;s hand was
steady when he picked up the letter it was because
his will kept it steady, and for no other reason.
As he held it in his hand, Mrs. Havergill came
bustling in with toast and coffee. David passed
her, went into his consulting room and shut the
door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;First he went red and then he went white,&rdquo;
she told Sarah, &ldquo;and he pushed past me as if I
were a stock, or a post, or something of that sort.
I &rsquo;ope he &rsquo;asn&rsquo;t caught one of them nasty fevers,
down in some slum. &rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t natural for a man to
turn colour that way. There was only one young
man ever I knew as did it, William Jones his name
was, and he was the sexton&rsquo;s son down at Dunnington.
And he&rsquo;d do it. Red one minute and white
the next, and then red again. And he went off
in a galloping decline, and broke his poor mother&rsquo;s
heart. And there&rsquo;s their two graves side by side
in Dunnington Churchyard. Mr. Jones, he dug
the graves hisself, and never rightly held his head
up after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David Blake sat down at his table and spread
out old Mr. Mottisfont&rsquo;s letter upon the desk in
front of him. It was a long letter, written in a
clear, pointed handwriting, which was characteristic
and unmistakable.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;My dear David,&rdquo;&mdash;wrote old Mr. Mottisfont,&mdash;&ldquo;My
dear David, I have just written a
letter to Edward&mdash;a blameless and beautiful
letter&mdash;in which I have announced my immediate,
or, as one might say, approximate intention of
committing suicide by the simple expedient of
first putting arsenic into a cup of tea and then
drinking the tea. I shall send Edward for the
tea, and I shall put the arsenic into it, under his
very nose. And Edward will be thinking of
beetles, and will not see me do it. I am prepared
to bet my bottom dollar that he does not see me
do it. Edward&rsquo;s letter, of which I enclose a copy,
is the sort of letter which one shows to coroners, and
jurymen, and legal advisers. Of course things
may not have gone as far as that, but, on the
other hand, they may. There are evil-minded
persons who may have suspected Edward of
having hastened my departure to a better world.
You may even have suspected him yourself, in
which case, of course, my dear David, this letter
will be affording you a good deal of pleasurable
relief.&rdquo; David clenched his hand and read on.
&ldquo;Edward&rsquo;s letter is for the coroner. It should
arrive about a fortnight after my death, if my
valued correspondent, William Giles, of New York,
does as I have asked him. This letter is for you.
Between ourselves, then, it was that possible
three years of yours that decided me. I couldn&rsquo;t
stand it. I don&rsquo;t believe in another world, and
I&rsquo;m damned if I&rsquo;ll put in three years&rsquo; hell in this
one. Do you remember old Madden? I do, and
I&rsquo;m not going to hang on like that, not to please
any one, nor I&rsquo;m not going to be cut up in sections
either. So now you know all about it.
I&rsquo;ve just sent Edward for the tea. Poor Edward,
it will hurt his feelings very much to be suspected
of polishing me off. By the way, David, as a sort
of last word&mdash;you&rsquo;re no end of a damn fool&mdash;why
don&rsquo;t you marry the right woman instead of
wasting your time hankering after the wrong one?
That&rsquo;s all. Here&rsquo;s luck.</p>
<p><span class="center">&ldquo;Yours.</span>
<span class="jr">&ldquo;E. M. M.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>David read the letter straight through without
any change of expression. When he came to the
end he folded the sheets neatly, put them back in
the envelope, and locked the envelope away in a
drawer. Then his face changed suddenly. First,
a great rush of colour came into it, and then every
feature altered under an access of blind and ungovernable
anger. He pushed back his chair and
sprang up, but the impetus which had carried him
to his feet appeared to receive some extraordinary
check. His movement had been a very violent
one, but all at once it passed into rigidity. He
stood with every muscle tense, and made neither
sound nor movement. Slowly the colour died
out of his face. Then he took a step backwards
and dropped again into the chair. His eyes were
fixed upon the strip of carpet which lay between
him and the writing-table. A small, twisted
scrap of paper was lying there. David Blake
looked hard at the paper, but he did not see it.
What he saw was another torn and twisted thing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>A man&rsquo;s professional honour is a very delicate
thing. David had never held his lightly. If he
had violated it, he had done so because there
were great things in the balance. Mary&rsquo;s happiness,
Mary&rsquo;s future, Mary&rsquo;s life. He had betrayed
a trust because Mary asked it of him and
because there was so much in the balance. And
it had all been illusion. There had been no risk&mdash;no
danger. Nothing but an old man&rsquo;s last and
cruelest jest. And he, David, had been the old
man&rsquo;s dupe. A furious anger surged in him. For
nothing, it was all for nothing. He had wrenched
himself for nothing, forfeited his self-respect for
nothing, sold his honour for nothing. Mary had
bidden him, and he had done her bidding, and it
was all for nothing. A little bleak sunlight came
in at the window and showed the worn patches
upon the carpet. David could remember that
old brown carpet for as long as he could remember
anything. It had been in his father&rsquo;s consulting
room. The writing-table had been there too.
The room was full of memories of William Blake.
Old familiar words and looks came back to David
as he sat there. He remembered many little
things, and, as he remembered, he despised himself
very bitterly. As the moments passed, so his
self-contempt grew, until it became unbearable.
He rose, pushing his chair so that it fell over with a
crash, and went into the dining-room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>Half an hour later Sarah put her head round the
corner of the door and announced, &ldquo;Mr. Edward
Mottisfont in the consulting room, sir.&rdquo; David
Blake was sitting at the round table with a decanter
in front of him. He got up with a short
laugh and went to Edward.</p>
<p>Edward presented a ruffled but resigned appearance.
He was agitated, but beneath the agitation
there was plainly evident a trace of melancholy
triumph.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a letter,&rdquo; he began. David stood
facing him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So have I,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Edward&rsquo;s wave of the hand dismissed as
irrelevant all letters except his own. &ldquo;But
mine&mdash;mine was from my uncle,&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. He was obliging enough to send me
a copy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you know,&rdquo; said Edward. Then he
searched his pockets, and ultimately produced
a folded letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had a letter like this? He&rsquo;s told you?
You know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That he&rsquo;s played us the dirtiest trick on
record? Yes, thanks, Edward, I&rsquo;ve been enjoying
the knowledge for the best part of an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edward shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he was mad,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have
often wondered if he was quite responsible. He
used to say such extraordinary things. If you
remember, I asked you about it once, and you
laughed at me. But now, of course, there is no
doubt about it. His brain had become affected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David&rsquo;s lip twitched a little.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mad? Oh, no, you needn&rsquo;t flatter yourself,
he wasn&rsquo;t mad. I only hope my wits may last as
well. He wasn&rsquo;t mad, but he&rsquo;s made the biggest
fools of the lot of us&mdash;the biggest fools. Oh, Lord!&mdash;how
he&rsquo;d have laughed. He set the stage, and
called the cast, and who so ready as we? First
Murderer&mdash;Edward Mottisfont; Chief Mourner&mdash;Mary,
his wife; and Tom Fool, beyond all other
Tom Fools, David Blake, M.D. My Lord, he
never said a truer word than when he wrote me
down a damn fool!&rdquo;</p>
<p>David ended on a note of concentrated bitterness,
and Edward stared at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would much rather believe he was out of his
mind,&rdquo; he said uncomfortably. &ldquo;And he is dead&mdash;after
all, he&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said David grimly, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And thanks to you,&rdquo; continued Edward,
&ldquo;there has been no scandal&mdash;or publicity. It
would really have been dreadful if it had all come
out. Most&mdash;most unpleasant. I know you
didn&rsquo;t wish me to say anything.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>Edward began to rumple his hair wildly.
&ldquo;Mary told me, and of course I know it&rsquo;s beastly
to be thanked, and all that, but I can&rsquo;t help saying
that&mdash;in fact&mdash;I <i>am</i> awfully grateful. And I&rsquo;m
awfully thankful that the matter has been cleared
up so satisfactorily. If we hadn&rsquo;t got this letter,
well&mdash;I don&rsquo;t like to say such a thing&mdash;but any
one of us might have come to suspect the other.
It doesn&rsquo;t sound quite right to say it,&rdquo; pursued
Edward apologetically, &ldquo;but it might have happened.
You might have suspected me&mdash;oh, I
don&rsquo;t mean really&mdash;I am only supposing, you
know&mdash;or I might have suspected you. And now
it&rsquo;s all cleared up, and no harm done, and as to
my poor old uncle, he was mad. People who
commit suicide are always mad. Every one
knows that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, have it your own way,&rdquo; said David Blake.
&ldquo;He was mad, and now everything is comfortably
arranged, and we can all settle down with nothing
on our minds, and live happily ever after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a savage sarcasm in his voice, which
he did not trouble to conceal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, look here,&rdquo; he went on with a sudden
change of manner. He straightened himself and
looked squarely at Edward Mottisfont. &ldquo;Those
letters have got to be kept.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I should have thought&mdash;&rdquo; began
Edward, but David broke in almost violently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t start thinking,
Edward.&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;Just you listen to me.
These letters have got to be kept. They&rsquo;ve
got to sit in a safe at a lawyer&rsquo;s. We&rsquo;ll seal &rsquo;em
up in the presence of witnesses, and send &rsquo;em off.
We&rsquo;re not out of the wood yet. If this business
were ever to leak out&mdash;and, after all, there are
four of us in it, and two of them are women&mdash;if
it were ever to leak out, we should want these letters
to save our necks. Yes&mdash;our necks. Good Lord,
Edward, did you never realise your position?
Did you never realise that any jury in the world
would have hanged you on the evidence? It was
damning&mdash;absolutely damning. And I come in
as accessory after the fact. No, thank you, I
think we&rsquo;ll keep the letters, until we&rsquo;re past
hanging. And there&rsquo;s another thing&mdash;how many
people have you told? Mary, of course?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mary, but no one else,&rdquo; said Edward.</p>
<p>David made an impatient movement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve told her, you&rsquo;ve told her,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Now what you&rsquo;ve got to do is this: you&rsquo;ve got
to rub it into Mary that it&rsquo;s just as important
for her to hold her tongue now as it was before the
letter came. She was safe as long as she thought
your neck was in danger, but do, for Heaven&rsquo;s
sake, get it into her head that I&rsquo;m dead damned
broke, if it ever gets out that I helped to hush up a
case that looked like murder and turned out to be
suicide. The law wouldn&rsquo;t hang me, but I should
probably hang myself. I&rsquo;d be <i>broke</i>. Rub that
in.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>&ldquo;She may have told Elizabeth,&rdquo; said Edward
hesitatingly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid she may have told
Elizabeth by now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elizabeth doesn&rsquo;t talk,&rdquo; said David shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor does Mary.&rdquo; Edward&rsquo;s tone was rather
aggrieved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no woman ever talks,&rdquo; said David.</p>
<p>He laughed harshly, and Edward went away
with his feelings of gratitude a little chilled, and
a faint suspicion in his mind that David had
been drinking.</p>

<p class="t0">You still shall say, &ldquo;God speed&rdquo; to me, and I, &ldquo;God go with you.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Some days later Elizabeth Chantrey went
away for about a month, to pay a few long-promised
visits. She went first to an old school-friend,
then to some relations, and lastly to the
Mainwarings. Agneta Mainwaring had moved
to town after her mother&rsquo;s death, and was sharing
a small flat with her brother Louis, in a very fashionable
quarter. She had been engaged for about
six months to Douglas Strange, and was expecting
to marry him as soon as he returned from his
latest, and most hazardous journey across Equatorial
Africa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you were never coming,&rdquo; said
Agneta, as they sat in the firelight, Louis on the
farther side of the room, close to the lamp, with
his head buried in a book.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;Never, never, <i>never</i>!&rdquo; repeated Agneta, stroking
the tail of Elizabeth&rsquo;s white gown affectionately
and nodding at every word. She was sitting
on the curly black hearth-rug, a small vivid creature
in a crimson dress. Agneta Mainwaring was
little and dark, passionate, earnest, and frivolous.
A creature of variable moods and intense
affections, steadfast only where she loved. Elizabeth
was watching the firelight upon the big
square sapphire ring which she always wore. She
looked up from it now and smiled at Agneta, just
a smile of the eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I am here,&rdquo; she said, and Agneta went
on stroking, and exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s so good to have you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The world not been going nicely?&rdquo; said
Elizabeth.</p>
<p>Agneta frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, so, so. Really, Lizabeth, being engaged
to an explorer is the <i>devil</i>. Sometimes I get a
letter two days running, and sometimes I don&rsquo;t
get one for two months, and I&rsquo;ve just been doing
the two months&rsquo; stretch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll soon be getting
two letters together, Neta.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, I did get one this morning, or I
shouldn&rsquo;t be talking about it,&rdquo; Agneta flushed and
laughed, then frowned again. Three little wrinkles
appeared upon her nose. &ldquo;What worries me is
that I am such a hopeless materialist about letters.
Letters are rank materialism. Rank. Two people
as much in touch with one another as Douglas and
I oughtn&rsquo;t to need letters. I&rsquo;ve no business to
be dependent on them. We ought to be able to
reach one another without them. Of course we
do&mdash;<i>really</i>&mdash;but we ought to know that we are
doing it. We ought to be conscious of it. I&rsquo;ve
no business to be dependent on wretched bits of
paper, and miserable penfuls of ink. I ought to be
able to do without them. And I&rsquo;m a blatant
materialist. I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth laughed a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t worry, if I were you. It&rsquo;ll all
come. You&rsquo;ll get past letters when you&rsquo;re
ready to get past them. I don&rsquo;t think your
materialism is of a very heavy order. It will go
away if you don&rsquo;t fuss over it. We&rsquo;ll all get past
letters in time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Agneta tossed her head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t suppose there&rsquo;ll be any letters
in heaven,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I trust
not. My idea is that we shall sit on nice
comfy clouds, and play at telephones with
thought-waves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louis shut his book with a bang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, Agneta, if that isn&rsquo;t materialism.&rdquo;
He came over and sat down on the hearth-rug beside
his sister. They were not at all alike. Where
Agneta was small, Louis was large. Her hair and
eyes were black, and his of a dark reddish-brown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you were listening,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I wasn&rsquo;t. I just heard, and I give you
fair warning, Agneta, that if there are going to be
telephones in your heaven, I&rsquo;m going somewhere
else. I shall have had enough of them here.
Hear the bells, the silver bells, the tintinabulation
that so musically swells. From the bells, bells,
bells, bells&mdash;bells, bells, bells.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Agneta first pulled Louis&rsquo;s hair, and then put
her fingers in her ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop! stop this minute! Oh, Louis, please.
Oh, Lizabeth, make him stop. That thing always
drives me perfectly crazy, and he knows it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. It&rsquo;s done. I&rsquo;ve finished. I&rsquo;m
much more merciful than Poe. I only wanted to
point out that if that was your idea of heaven, it
wasn&rsquo;t mine.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, good gracious!&rdquo; cried Agneta suddenly.
She sprang up and darted to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve absolutely and entirely forgotten to
order any food for to-morrow. Any food whatever.
All right, Louis, you won&rsquo;t laugh when
you have to lunch on bread and water, and
Lizabeth takes the afternoon train back to her
horrible Harford place, because we have starved
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louis gave a resigned sigh and leaned comfortably
back against an empty chair. For some
moments he gazed dreamily at Elizabeth. Then
he said: &ldquo;How nicely your hair shines. I like you
all white and gold like that. If Browning had
known you he needn&rsquo;t have written. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s
become of all the gold, used to hang and brush
their bosoms.&rsquo; You&rsquo;ve got your share.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But my hair isn&rsquo;t golden at all, Louis,&rdquo; said
Elizabeth.</p>
<p>Louis frowned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s gold without the
dross&mdash;gold spiritualised. And you ought to
know better than to pretend. You know as well
as I do that your hair is a thing of beauty. The
real joy for ever sort. It&rsquo;s no credit to you.
You didn&rsquo;t make it. And you ought to be properly
grateful for being allowed to walk about with
a real live halo. Why should you pretend? If it
wasn&rsquo;t pretence, you wouldn&rsquo;t take so much
trouble about doing it. You&rsquo;d just twist it up
on a single hairpin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t stay up,&rdquo; said Elizabeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish it wouldn&rsquo;t. Oh, Lizabeth, won&rsquo;t
you let it down just for once?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, with pleasant
firmness.</p>
<p>Louis fell into a gloom. His brown eyes
darkened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why,&rdquo; he said; and Elizabeth
laughed at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Louis, will you ever grow up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louis assumed an air of dignity. &ldquo;My last
book,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;was not only very well reviewed
by competent and appreciative persons, but I
would have you to know that it also brought me
in quite a large and solid cheque. And my poems
have had what is known as a <i>succ&egrave;s d&rsquo;estime</i>,
which means that you and your publisher lose
money, but the critics say nice things. These
facts, my dear madam, all point to my having
emerged from the nursery.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;Go on emerging, Louis,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, with
a little nod of encouragement. Louis appeared
to be plunged in thought. He frowned, made
calculations upon his fingers, and finally inquired:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many times have I proposed to you,
Lizabeth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth looked at him with amusement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really never counted. Do you want me
to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I think I&rsquo;ve got it right. I think it
must be eight times, because I know I began
when I was twenty, and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve missed
a year since. This,&rdquo; said Louis, getting on to his
knees and coming nearer, &ldquo;this will be number
nine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Louis, don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Elizabeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it really isn&rsquo;t kind. Do you want
me to go away to-morrow? If you propose to me,
and I refuse you, every possible rule of propriety
demands that I should immediately return to
Market Harford. And I don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo; Louis
hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long are you staying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice, hospitable young man. Agneta has
asked me to stay for a fortnight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo; Louis sat back upon his heels.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s talk about books. Have you read Pender&rsquo;s
last? It&rsquo;s a wonder&mdash;just a wonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Elizabeth enjoyed her fortnight&rsquo;s stay very
much. She was glad to be away from Market
Harford, and she was glad to be with Agneta and
Louis. She saw one or two good plays, had a
great deal of talk of the kind she had been starving
for, and met a good many people who were doing
interesting things. On the last day of her visit
Agneta said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you go back to Market Harford for a year.
Is it because Mr. Mottisfont asked you to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Partly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a little pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do with your life,
Lizabeth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth looked steadily at the blue of her
ring. Her eyes were very deep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Neta. I&rsquo;m waiting to be told.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Agneta nodded, and looked understanding.
&ldquo;And if you aren&rsquo;t told?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I shall be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if not?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that would be a telling in itself. If
nothing happens before the year is up, I shall
come up to London, and find some work. There&rsquo;s
plenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Agneta. She put her little pointed
chin in her hands and gazed at Elizabeth. There
was something almost fierce in her eyes. She knew
very little about David Blake, but she guessed
a good deal more. And there were moments
when it would have given her a great deal of
pleasure to have spoken her mind on the subject.</p>
<p>They sat for a little while in silence, and then
Louis came in, and wandered about the room
until Agneta exclaimed at him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do, for goodness&rsquo; sake, sit down, Louis! You
give me the fidgets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louis drifted over to the hearth. &ldquo;Have you
ordered any meals,&rdquo; he said, with apparent
irrelevance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tea, dinner, breakfast, lunch, tea, and dinner
again.&rdquo; Agneta&rsquo;s tone was vicious. &ldquo;Is that
enough for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, run away and write a letter
to Douglas. I believe you are neglecting him,
and there&rsquo;s a nice fire in the dining-room.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>Agneta rose with outraged dignity. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
write my love-letters to order, thank you,&rdquo; she
said &ldquo;and you needn&rsquo;t worry about Douglas. If
you want me to go away, I don&rsquo;t mind taking a
book into the dining-room. Though, if you&rsquo;ll
take my advice&mdash;but you won&rsquo;t&mdash;so I&rsquo;ll just
leave you to find out for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louis shut the door after her, and came back to
Elizabeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Number nine,&rdquo; he observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Louis, don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to. You are in for it, Lizabeth.
Your visit is over, so you can&rsquo;t accuse me of spoiling
it. Number nine, and a fortnight overdue.
Here goes. For the ninth time of asking, will you
marry me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth shook her head at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Louis, I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Louis looked at her steadily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the ninth time I have asked you. How
many times have you taken me seriously, Lizabeth?
Not once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have been so very sorry to take you
seriously, you see, Louis dear,&rdquo; said Elizabeth,
speaking very sweetly and gently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>Louis Mainwaring walked to the window and
stood there in silence for a minute or two. Elizabeth
began to look troubled. When he turned
round and came back his face was rather
white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve never taken me seriously&mdash;never
once. But it&rsquo;s been serious enough,
for me. You never thought it went deep&mdash;but
it did. Some people hide their deep things under
silence&mdash;every one can understand that. Others
hide theirs under words&mdash;a great many light
words. Jests. That&rsquo;s been my way. It&rsquo;s a
better mask than the other, but I don&rsquo;t want any
mask between us now. I want you to understand.
We&rsquo;ve always talked about my being in love with
you. We&rsquo;ve always laughed about it, but now I
want you to understand. It&rsquo;s me, the whole of
me&mdash;all there is&mdash;all there ever will be&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was stammering now and almost incoherent.
His hand shook. Elizabeth got up quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Louis dear, Louis dear,&rdquo; she said. She
put her arm half round him, and for a moment he
leaned his head against her shoulder. When he
raised it he was trying to smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Lady of Consolation,&rdquo; he said, and then,
&ldquo;how you would spoil a man whom you loved!
There, Lizabeth, you needn&rsquo;t worry about it.
You see, I&rsquo;ve always known that you would never
love me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Louis, but I love you very much, only
not just like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know. I&rsquo;ve always known it and
I&rsquo;ve always known that there was some one else
whom you did love&mdash;just like that. What I&rsquo;ve
been waiting for is to see it making you happy.
And it doesn&rsquo;t make you happy. It never has.
And, lately, there&rsquo;s been something fresh&mdash;something
that has hurt. You&rsquo;ve been very unhappy.
As soon as you came here I knew. What is it?
Can&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth sat down again, but she did not turn
her eyes away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Louis, I don&rsquo;t think I can,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>Louis&rsquo;s chin lifted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does Agneta know?&rdquo; he asked with a quick
flash of jealousy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, reprovingly.
&ldquo;And she has never asked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louis laughed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s for my conscience, I suppose,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t mind. I can bear it a lot better if
you haven&rsquo;t told Agneta. And look here, Lizabeth,
even if you never tell me a single word, I
shall always know things about you&mdash;things that
matter. I&rsquo;ve always known when things went
wrong with you, and I always shall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was obviously quite as an afterthought that
he added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, slowly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I
mind. But don&rsquo;t look too close, Louis dear&mdash;not
just now. It&rsquo;s kinder not to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Louis.</p>
<p>Then he came over and stood beside her. &ldquo;Lizabeth,
if there&rsquo;s anything I can do&mdash;any sort or
kind of thing&mdash;you&rsquo;re to let me know. You will,
won&rsquo;t you? You&rsquo;re the best thing in my world,
and anything that I can do for you would be the
best day&rsquo;s work I ever did. If you&rsquo;ll just clamp
on to that we shall be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth looked up, but before she could speak,
he bent down, kissed her hastily on the cheek,
and went out of the room.</p>
<p>Elizabeth put her face in her hands and
cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose Louis has been proposing to you
again,&rdquo; was Agneta&rsquo;s rather cross comment.
&ldquo;Lizabeth, what on earth are you crying for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Neta, do you hate me?&rdquo; said Elizabeth
in a very tired voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Agneta knelt down beside her, and began to
pinch her arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would if I could, but I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she observed
viciously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried, of course, but I can&rsquo;t
do it by myself, and it&rsquo;s not the sort of thing you
can expect religion to be any help in. As if you
didn&rsquo;t know that Louis and I simply love your
littlest finger-nail, and that we&rsquo;d do anything for
you, and that we think it an <i>honour</i> to be your
friends, and&mdash;oh, Lizabeth, if you don&rsquo;t stop
crying this very instant, I shall pour all the water
out of that big flower-vase down the back of your
neck!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">EDWARD SINGS</span></h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;What ails you, Andrew, my man&rsquo;s son,</p>
<p class="t">That you should look so white,</p>
<p class="t0">That you should neither eat by day,</p>
<p class="t">Nor take your rest by night?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I have no rest when I would sleep,</p>
<p class="t">No peace when I would rise,</p>

<p class="t">Because of Janet&rsquo;s eyes.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>When Elizabeth Chantrey returned to Market
Harford, she did so with quite a clear
understanding of the difficulties that lay before
her. Edward had spoken to her of his uncle&rsquo;s
wishes, and begged her to fulfil them by remaining
on in the old house as his and Mary&rsquo;s guest.
Apparently it never occurred to him that the
situation presented any difficulty, or that few
women would find it agreeable to be guest where
they had been mistress. Elizabeth was under no
illusions. She knew that she was putting herself
in an almost impossible position, but she had made
up her mind to occupy that position for a year.
She had given David Blake so much already,
that a little more did not seem to matter. Another
year, a little more pain, were all in the day&rsquo;s
work. She had given many years and had suffered
much pain. Through the years, through the
pain, there had been at the back of her mind the
thought, &ldquo;If he needed me, and I were not here.&rdquo;
Elizabeth had always known that some day he
would need her&mdash;not love her&mdash;but need her.
And for that she waited.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>Elizabeth returned to Market Harford on a
fine November afternoon. The sun was shining,
after two days&rsquo; rain, and Elizabeth walked up
from the station, leaving her luggage to the carrier.
It was quite a short walk, but she met so many
acquaintances that she was some time reaching
home. First, it was old Dr. Bull with his square
face and fringe of stiff grey beard who waved his
knobbly stick at her, and waddled across the
road. He was a great friend of Elizabeth&rsquo;s, and
he greeted her warmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, now, Miss Elizabeth, so you&rsquo;ve not
quite deserted us, hey? Glad to be back, hey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, very glad,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, smiling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>&ldquo;And every one will be glad to see you, all your
friends. Hey? I&rsquo;m glad, Edward and Mary&rsquo;ll
be glad, and David&mdash;hey? David&rsquo;s a friend of
yours, isn&rsquo;t he? Used to be, I know, in the old
days. Prodigious allies you were. Always in
each other&rsquo;s pockets. Same books&mdash;same walks&mdash;same
measles&mdash;&rdquo; he laughed heartily, and then
broke off. &ldquo;David wants his friends,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;for the matter of that, every one wants friends,
hey? But you get David to come and see you,
my dear. He won&rsquo;t want much persuading, hey?
Well, well, I won&rsquo;t keep you. I mustn&rsquo;t waste
your time. Now that I&rsquo;m idle, I forget that
other people have business, hey? And I see Miss
Dobell coming over to speak to you. Now, I
wouldn&rsquo;t waste her time for the world. Not for
the world, my dear Miss Elizabeth. Good-day,
good-day, good-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes twinkled as he raised his hat, and he
went off at an astonishing rate, as Miss Dobell
picked her way across the road.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>&ldquo;Such a fine man, Dr. Bull, I always think,&rdquo;
she remarked in her precise little way. Every
word she uttered had the effect of being enclosed
in a separate little water-tight compartment. &ldquo;I
really miss him, if I may say so. Oh, yes; and I
am not the only one of his old patients who feels
it a deprivation to have lost his services. Oh, no.
Young men are so unreliable. They begin well,
but they are unreliable. Oh, yes, sadly unreliable,&rdquo;
repeated Miss Dobell with emphasis.</p>
<p>She and Elizabeth were crossing the bridge as
she spoke. Away to the left, above the water,
Elizabeth could see the sunlight reflected from
the long line of windows which faced the river.
The trees before them were almost leafless, and it
was easy to distinguish one house from another.
David Blake lived in the seventh house, and Miss
Dobell was gazing very pointedly in that direction,
and nodding her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dislike gossip,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I set my face
against gossip, my dear Elizabeth, I do not approve
of it. I do not talk scandal nor permit it to
be talked in my presence. But I am not blind, or
deaf. Oh, no. We should be thankful when we
have all our faculties, and mine are unimpaired,
oh, yes, quite unimpaired, although I am not
quite as young as you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said Elizabeth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>Miss Dobell became rather flustered. &ldquo;I have
a little errand,&rdquo; she said hurriedly. &ldquo;A little
errand, my dear Elizabeth. I will not keep you,
oh, no, I must not keep you now. I shall see you
later, I shall come and see you, but I will not detain
you now. Oh, no, Mary will be waiting for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you have really come,&rdquo; said Mary a little
later.</p>
<p>After kissing her sister warmly, she had allowed
a slight air of offence to appear. &ldquo;I had begun to
think you had missed your train. I am afraid the
tea will be rather strong, I had it made punctually,
you see. I was beginning to think that you
hadn&rsquo;t been able to tear yourself away from
Agneta after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Molly&mdash;&rdquo; said Elizabeth, protestingly.</p>
<p>But Mary was not to be turned aside. &ldquo;Of
course you would much rather have stayed, I
know that. Will you have bread and butter or
tea-cake? When Mr. Mottisfont died, I said to
myself, &lsquo;Now she&rsquo;ll go and live with Agneta, and
she might just as well be <i>dead</i>.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s why I was
quite pleased when Edward came and told me
that Mr. Mottisfont had said you were to stay on
here for a year. Of course, as I said to Edward,
he had no right to make any such condition, and
if it had been any one but you, I shouldn&rsquo;t have
liked it at all. That&rsquo;s what I said to Edward&mdash;&lsquo;It
really isn&rsquo;t fair, but Elizabeth isn&rsquo;t like other
people. She won&rsquo;t try and run the house over my
head, and she won&rsquo;t want to be always with us.&rsquo;
You see, married people do like to have their
evenings, but as I said to Edward, &lsquo;Elizabeth
would much rather be in her own little room, with
a book, than sitting with us.&rsquo; And you would,
wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Elizabeth laughing.</p>
<p>The spectacle of Mary being tactful always
made her laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course when any one comes in in the evening&mdash;that&rsquo;s
different. Of course you&rsquo;ll join us
then. But you&rsquo;d rather be here as a rule, wouldn&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you know I love my little room. It was
nice of you to have tea here, Molly,&rdquo; said Elizabeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I thought you&rsquo;d like it. And then I
wanted the rest of the house to be a surprise to
you. When we&rsquo;ve had tea I want to show you
everything. Of course your rooms haven&rsquo;t been
touched, you said you&rsquo;d rather they weren&rsquo;t; but
everything else has been done up, and I really
think it&rsquo;s very nice. I&rsquo;ve been quite excited
over it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me a little more tea, Molly,&rdquo; said
Elizabeth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>As she leaned forward with her cup in her hand,
she asked casually: &ldquo;Have you seen much of
David lately?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s here very often.&rdquo;
She pursed her lips a little. &ldquo;I think David is a
<i>very</i> curious person, Liz. I don&rsquo;t understand him
at all. I think he is very difficult to understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he, Molly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth looked at her sister with something
between anxiety and amusement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, very. He&rsquo;s quite changed, it seems to
me. I could understand his being upset just
after Mr. Mottisfont&rsquo;s death. We were all upset
then. I am sure I never felt so dreadful in my
life. It made me quite ill. But afterwards,&rdquo;
Mary&rsquo;s voice dropped to a lower tone, &ldquo;afterwards
when the letter had come, and everything was
cleared up&mdash;well, you&rsquo;d have thought he would
have been all right again, wouldn&rsquo;t you? And
instead, he has just gone on getting more and more
unlike himself. You know, he was so odd when
Edward went to see him that, really,&rdquo;&mdash;Mary
hesitated&mdash;&ldquo;Edward thought&mdash;well, he wondered
whether David had been drinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Molly!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s not only Edward&mdash;everybody has
noticed how changed he is. Have you got anything
to eat, Liz? Have some of the iced cake;
it&rsquo;s from a recipe of Miss Dobell&rsquo;s and it&rsquo;s quite
nice. What was I saying? Oh, about David&mdash;well,
it&rsquo;s true, Liz&mdash;Mrs. Havergill told Markham;
now, Liz, what&rsquo;s the sense of your looking at me
like that? Of <i>course</i> I shouldn&rsquo;t <i>dream</i> of talking
to an ordinary servant, but considering Markham
has known us since we were about two&mdash;Markham
takes an interest, a real interest, and when Mrs.
Havergill told her that she was afraid David was
taking a great deal more than was good for him,
and she wished his friends could stop it, why,
Markham naturally told me. She felt it her
duty. I expect she thought I might have an
<i>influence</i>&mdash;as I hope I have. That&rsquo;s why I
encourage David to come here. I think it&rsquo;s so
good for him. I think it makes such a difference
to young men if they have a nice home to come to,
and it&rsquo;s very good for them to see married people
fond of each other, and happy together, like
Edward and I are. Don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Molly,&rdquo; said Elizabeth. &ldquo;Are
people talking about David?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they are. Of course I haven&rsquo;t said a
word, but people are noticing how different he is.
I don&rsquo;t see how they can help it, and yesterday
when I was having tea with Mrs. Codrington, Miss
Dobell began to hint all sorts of things, and there
was quite a scene. You know how devoted Mrs.
Codrington is! She really quite frightened poor
little Miss Hester. I can tell you, I was glad that
I hadn&rsquo;t said anything. Mrs. Codrington always
frightens me. She looks so large, and she speaks
so loud. I was quite glad to get away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like Mrs. Codrington,&rdquo; said Elizabeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, so do I. But I like her better when
she&rsquo;s not angry. Oh, by the way, Liz, talking of
David, do you know that I met Katie Ellerton
yesterday, and&mdash;how long is it since Dr. Ellerton
died?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than two years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she has gone quite out of mourning.
You know how she went on at first&mdash;she was
going to wear weeds always, and never change anything,
and as to ever going into colours again, she
couldn&rsquo;t imagine how any one could do it! And
I met her out yesterday in quite a bright blue
coat and skirt. What do you think of that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Molly, you&rsquo;ve been going out to too
many tea-parties! Why shouldn&rsquo;t poor Katie
go out of mourning? I think it&rsquo;s very sensible
of her. I have always been so sorry for
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary assumed an air of lofty virtue. &ldquo;I <i>used</i>
to be. But now, I don&rsquo;t approve of her at all.
She&rsquo;s just doing her very best to catch David
Blake. Every one can see it. If that wretched
little Ronnie has so much as a thorn in his finger,
she sends for David. She&rsquo;s making herself the
laughing-stock of the place. I think it&rsquo;s simply
horrid. I don&rsquo;t approve of second marriages at all.
I never do see how any really nice-minded woman
can marry again. And it&rsquo;s not only the marrying,
but to run after a man, like that&mdash;it&rsquo;s quite dreadful!
I am sure David would be most unhappy if
he married her. It would be a dreadfully bad
thing for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth leaned back in her chair.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;How sweet the hour that sets us free</p>
<p class="t0">To sip our scandal, and our tea,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>she observed.</p>
<p>Mary coloured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never talk scandal,&rdquo; she said in an offended
voice, and Elizabeth refrained from telling her
that Miss Dobell had made the same remark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>All the time that Mary was showing her over
the house, Elizabeth was wondering whether it
would be such a dreadfully bad thing for David
to marry Katie Ellerton. Ronnie was a dear
little boy, and David loved children, and Katie&mdash;Katie
was one of those gentle, clinging creatures
whom men adore and spoil. If she cared for him,
and he grew to care for her&mdash;Elizabeth turned the
possibilities over and over in her mind, wondering&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>She wondered still more that evening, when
David Blake came in after dinner. He had
changed. Elizabeth looked at him and saw things
in his face which she only half understood. He
looked ill and tired, but both illness and weariness
appeared to her to be incidental. Behind them
there was something else, something much stronger
and yet more subtle, some deflection of the man&rsquo;s
whole nature.</p>
<p>Edward and Mary did not disturb themselves
at David&rsquo;s coming. They were at the piano,
and Edward nodded casually, whilst Mary merely
waved her hand and smiled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>David said &ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; to Elizabeth,
and sat down by the fire. He was in evening dress,
but somehow he looked out of place in Mary&rsquo;s
new white drawing-room. Edward had put in
electric light all over the house, and here it shone
through rosy shades. The room was all rose and
white&mdash;roses on the chintz, a frieze of roses
upon the walls, and a rose-coloured carpet on
the floor. Only the two lamps over the piano
were lighted. They shone on Mary. She was
playing softly impassioned chords in support of
Edward, who exercised a pleasant tenor voice
upon the lays of Lord Henry Somerset. Mary
played accompaniments with much sentiment.
Occasionally, when the music was easy, she shot
an adoring glance at Edward, a glance to which
he duly responded, when not preoccupied with
a note beyond his compass.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>Elizabeth was tolerant of lovers, and Mary&rsquo;s
little sentimentalities, like Mary&rsquo;s airs of virtuous
matronhood, were often quite amusing to watch;
but to-night, with David Blake as a fourth person
in the room, Elizabeth found amusement merging
into irritation and irritation into pain. Except
for that lighted circle about the piano, the room
lay all in shadow. There was a soft dusk upon it,
broken every now and then by gleams of firelight.
David Blake sat back in his chair, and the dimness
of the room hid his face, except when the fire
blazed up and showed Elizabeth how changed it
was. She had been away only a month, and he
looked like a stranger. His attitude was that of a
very weary man. His head rested on his hand,
and he looked all the time at Mary in the rosy glow
which bathed her. When she looked up at Edward,
he saw the look, saw the light shine down
into her dark eyes and sparkle there. Not a look,
not a smile was lost, and whilst he watched Mary,
Elizabeth watched him. Elizabeth was very glad
of the dimness that shielded her. It was a relief
to drop the mask of a friendly indifference, to be
able to watch David with no thought except for
him. Her heart yearned to him as never before.
She divined in him a great hunger&mdash;a great pain.
And this hunger, this pain, was hers. The longing
to give, to assuage, to comfort, welled up in her
with a suddenness and strength that were almost
startling. Elizabeth took her thought in a strong
hand, forcing it along accustomed channels from
the plane where love may be thwarted, to that
other plane, where love walks unashamed and
undeterred, and gives her gifts, no man forbidding
her. Elizabeth sat still, with folded hands. Her
love went out to David, like one ripple in
a boundless, golden sea, from which they drew
their being, and in which they lived and moved.
A sense of light and peace came down upon
her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>Edward&rsquo;s voice was filling the room. It was
quite a pleasant voice, and if it never varied into
expression, at least it never went out of tune,
and every word was distinct.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Ah, well, I know the sadness</p>
<p class="t">That tears and rends your heart,</p>
<p class="t0">How that from all life&rsquo;s gladness</p>
<p class="t">You stand far, far apart&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>sang Edward, in tones of the most complete
unconcern.</p>
<p>It was Mary who supplied all the sentiment
that could be wished for. She dwelt on the chords
with an almost superfluous degree of feeling, and
her eyes were quite moist.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>At any other time this combination of Edward
and Lord Henry Somerset would have entertained
Elizabeth not a little, but just now there was no
room in her thoughts for any one but David.
The light that was upon her gave her vision.
She looked upon David with eyes that had grown
very clear, and as she looked she understood.
That he had changed, deteriorated, she had seen
at the first glance. Now she discerned in him the
cause of such an alteration&mdash;something wrenched
and twisted. The scene in her little brown room
rose vividly before her. When David had allowed
Mary to sway him, he had parted with something,
which he could not now recall. He had broken violently
through his own code, and the broken thing
was failing him at every turn. Mary&rsquo;s eyes, Mary&rsquo;s
voice, Mary&rsquo;s touch&mdash;these things had waked in
him something beyond the old passion. The
emotional strain of that scene had carried him beyond
his self-control. A feverish craving was upon
him, and his whole nature burned in the flame of it.</p>
<p>Edward had passed to another song.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>&ldquo;One more kiss from my darling one,&rdquo; he sang
in a slightly perfunctory manner. His voice was
getting tired, and he seemed a little absent-minded
for a lover who was about to plunge into Eternity.
The manner in which he requested death to come
speedily was a trifle unconvincing. As he began
the next verse David made a sudden movement.
A log of wood upon the fire had fallen sharply, and
there was a quick upward rush of flame. David
looked round, facing the glow, and as he did so his
eyes met Elizabeth&rsquo;s. Just for one infinitesimal
moment something seemed to pass from her to
him. It was one of those strange moments which
are not moments of time at all, and are therefore
not subject to time&rsquo;s laws. Elizabeth Chantrey&rsquo;s
eyes were full of peace. Full, too, of a passionate
gentleness. It was a gentleness which for an
instant touched the sore places in David&rsquo;s soul
with healing, and for that one instant David had a
glimpse of something very strong, very tender,
that was his, and yet incomprehensibly withheld
from his understanding. It was one of those
instantaneous flashes of thought&mdash;one of those
gleams of recognition which break upon the dulness
of material sense. Before and after&mdash;darkness,
the void, the unstarred night, a chaos of
things forgotten. But for one dazzled instant,
the lightning stab of Truth, unrealised.</p>
<p>Elizabeth did not look away, or change colour.
The peace was upon her still. She smiled a little,
and as the moment passed, and the dark closed in
again upon David&rsquo;s mind, she saw a spark of
rather savage humour come into his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then come Eternity&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s enough, Mary, I&rsquo;m absolutely
hoarse,&rdquo; remarked Edward, all in the same breath,
and with very much the same expression.</p>
<p>Mary got up, and began to shut the piano.
The light shone on her white, uncovered neck.</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Through fire and frost and snow</p>

<p class="t0">I see your feet that bleed,</p>
<p class="t">My heart bleeds too.</p>

<p class="t">What can I do?</p>

</div>
<p>That first evening was one of many others,
all on very much the same pattern. David
Blake would come in, after tea, or after dinner, sit
for an hour in almost total silence, and then go
away again. Every time that he came, Elizabeth&rsquo;s
heart sank a little lower. This change, this
obscuring of the man she loved, was an unreality,
but how some unrealities have power to hurt us.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>December brought extra work to the Market
Harford doctors. There was an epidemic of
measles amongst the children, combined with one
of influenza amongst their elders. David Blake
stood the extra strain but ill. He was slipping
steadily down the hill. His day&rsquo;s work followed
only too often upon a broken or sleepless night,
and to get through what had to be done, or to
secure some measure of sleep, he had recourse more
and more frequently to stimulant. If no patient
of his ever saw him the worse for drink, he was
none the less constantly under its influence. If
it did not intoxicate him, he came to rely upon
its stimulus, and to distrust his unaided strength.
He could no longer count upon his nerve, and
the fear of all that nerve failure may involve
haunted him continually and drove him down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Blake, you want a change. Why
don&rsquo;t you go away?&rdquo; said Tom Skeffington. It
was a late January evening, and he had dropped
in for a smoke and a chat. &ldquo;The press of work
is over now, and I could very well manage the lot
for a fortnight or three weeks. Will you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said David shortly.</p>
<p>Young Skeffington paused. It was not much
after six in the evening, and David&rsquo;s face was
flushed, his hand unsteady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Blake,&rdquo; he said, and then stopped,
because David was staring at him out of eyes that
had suddenly grown suspicious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said David, still staring.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I should go away if I were you&mdash;go to
Switzerland, do some winter sports. Get a thorough
change. Come back yourself again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was ever so slight an emphasis on the
last few words, and David flashed into sudden
anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind your own business, and be damned to
you, Skeffington,&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>Tom Skeffington shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, certainly,&rdquo; he said, and made haste to
be gone.</p>
<p>Blake in this mood was quite impracticable.
He had no mind for a scene.</p>
<p>David sat on, with a tumbler at his elbow. So
they wanted him out of the way. That was the
third person who had told him he needed a change&mdash;the
third in one week. Edward was one, and
old Dr. Bull, and now Skeffington. Yes, of course,
Skeffington would like him out of the way, so as
to get all the practice into his own hands. Edward
too. Was it this morning, or yesterday morning,
that Edward had asked him when he was going
to take a holiday? Now he came to think of it,
it was yesterday morning. And he supposed that
Edward wanted him out of the way too. Perhaps
he went too often to Edward&rsquo;s house. David
began to get angry. Edward was an ungrateful
hound. &ldquo;Damned ungrateful,&rdquo; said David&rsquo;s
muddled brain. The idea of going to see Mary
began to present itself to him. If Edward did not
like it, Edward could lump it. He had been told
to come whenever he liked. Very well, he liked
now. Why shouldn&rsquo;t he?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>He got up and went out into the cold. Then,
when he was half-way up the High Street he remembered
that Edward had gone away for a couple
of days. It occurred to him as a very agreeable
circumstance. Mary would be alone, and they
would have a pleasant, friendly time together.
Mary would sit in the rosy light and play to him,
not to Edward, and sing in that small sweet voice
of hers&mdash;not to Edward, but to him.</p>
<p>It was a cold, crisp night, and the frosty air
heightened the effect of the stimulant which he
had taken. He had left his own house flushed,
irritable, and warm, but he arrived at the Mottisfonts&rsquo;
as unmistakably drunk as a man may be who
is still upon his legs.</p>
<p>He brushed past Markham in the hall before
she had time to do more than notice that his
manner was rather odd, and she called after him
that Mrs. Mottisfont was in the drawing-room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>David went up the stairs walking quite steadily,
but his brain, under the influence of one idea,
appeared to work in a manner entirely divorced
from any volition of his.</p>
<p>Mary was sitting before the fire, in the rosy
glow of his imagining. She wore a dim purple
gown, with a border of soft dark fur. A book
lay upon her lap, but she was not reading. Her
head, with its dark curls, rested against the rose-patterned
chintz of the chair. Her skin was as
white as a white rose leaf. Her lips as softly red
as real red roses. A little amethyst heart hung
low upon her bosom and caught the light. There
was a bunch of violets at her waist. The room
was sweet with them.</p>
<p>Mary looked up half startled as David Blake
came in. He shut the door behind him, with a
push, and she was startled outright when she saw
his face. He looked at her with glazed eyes, and
smiled a meaningless and foolish smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Edward is out,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;he is away.&rdquo;
And then she wished that she had said anything
else. She looked at the bell, and wondered where
Elizabeth was. Elizabeth had said something
about going out&mdash;one of her sick people.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;out,&rdquo; said David, still smiling. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
why I&rsquo;ve come. He&rsquo;s out&mdash;Edward&rsquo;s out&mdash;gone
away. You&rsquo;ll play to me&mdash;not to Edward&mdash;to-night.
You&rsquo;ll sit in this nice pink light and&mdash;play
to me, won&rsquo;t you&mdash;Mary dear?&rdquo; The
words slipped into one another, tripped, jostled,
and came with a run.</p>
<p>David advanced across the room, moving with
caution, and putting each foot down slowly and
carefully. His irritability had vanished. He felt
instead a pleasant sense of warmth and satisfaction.
He let himself sink into a chair and gazed
at Mary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Le&rsquo;s sit down&mdash;and have nice long talk,&rdquo;
he said in an odd, thick voice; &ldquo;we haven&rsquo;t had&mdash;nice
long talk&mdash;for months. Le&rsquo;s talk now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary began to tremble. Except in the streets,
she had never seen a man drunk before, and even
in the streets, passing by on the other side of the
road, under safe protection, and with head averted,
she had felt sick and terrified. What she felt
now she hardly knew. She looked at the bell.
She would have to pass quite close to David before
she could reach it. Elizabeth&mdash;she might ring
and ask if Elizabeth had come in. Yes, she
might do that. She made a step forward, but
as she reached to touch the bell, David leaned
sideways, with a sudden heavy jerk, and caught
her by the wrist.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that for?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Suspicion roused in him again, and he frowned
as he spoke. His face was very red, and his eyes
looked black. Mary had cried out, when he
caught her wrist. Now, as he continued to hold
it, she stared at him in helpless silence. Then
quite suddenly she burst into hysterical tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go&mdash;oh, let me go! Go away, you&rsquo;re
not fit to be here! You&rsquo;re drunk. Let me go at
once! How dare you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>David continued to hold her wrist, not of any
set purpose, but stupidly. He seemed to have forgotten
to let it go. The heat and pressure of his
hand, his slow vacant stare, terrified Mary out
of all self-control. She tried to pull her hand
away, and as David&rsquo;s clasp tightened, and she
felt her own helplessness, she screamed aloud, and
almost as she did so the door opened sharply and
Elizabeth Chantrey came into the room. She
wore a long green coat, and dark furs, and her
colour was bright and clear with exercise. For
one startled second she stood just inside the room,
with her hand upon the door. Then, as she made
a step forward, David relaxed his grasp, and
Mary, wrenching her hand away, ran sobbing to
meet her sister.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Liz! Oh, Liz!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was cold to the very heart. David&rsquo;s
face&mdash;the heavy, animal look upon it&mdash;and Mary&rsquo;s
frightened pallor, the terror in her eyes. What
had happened?</p>
<p>She caught Mary by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He held me&mdash;he wouldn&rsquo;t let me go. He
caught my wrist when I was going to ring
the bell, and held it. Make him go away,
Liz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth drew a long breath of relief. She
scarcely knew what she had feared, but she felt
suddenly as if an intolerable weight had been
lifted from her mind. The removal of this weight
set her free to think and act.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Molly, hush! Do you hear me, hush! Pull
yourself together! Do you know I heard you
scream half-way up the stairs? Do you want the
servants to hear too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke in low, rapid tones, and Mary caught
her breath like a child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s tipsy, Liz. Oh, Liz, make him go
away,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>David had got upon his feet. He was looking
at the two women with a puzzled frown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he said slowly, and
Mary turned on him with a sudden spurt of
temper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder you&rsquo;re not ashamed,&rdquo; she said in
rather a trembling voice. &ldquo;I do wonder you&rsquo;re
not&mdash;and will you please go away at once, or do
you want the servants to come in, and every one to
know how disgracefully you have behaved?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Molly, hush!&rdquo; said Elizabeth again.</p>
<p>Her own colour died away, leaving her very pale.
Her eyes were fixed on David with a look between
pity and appeal. She left Mary and went to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;David,&rdquo; she said, putting her hand on his arm,
&ldquo;won&rsquo;t you go home now? It&rsquo;s getting late.
It&rsquo;s nearly dinner time, and I&rsquo;m afraid we can&rsquo;t
ask you to stay to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>Something in her manner sobered David a
little. Mary had screamed&mdash;why? What had he
said to her&mdash;or done? She was angry. Why?
Why did Elizabeth look at him like that? His
mind was very much confused. Amid the confusion
an idea presented itself to him. They
thought that he was drunk. Well, he would
show them, he would show them that he was not
drunk. He stood for a moment endeavouring to
bring the confusion of his brain into something
like order. Then without a word he walked past
Mary, and out of the room, walking quite steadily
because a sober man walks steadily and he had
to show them that he was sober.</p>
<p>Mary stood by the door listening. &ldquo;Liz,&rdquo;
she whispered, &ldquo;he hasn&rsquo;t gone down-stairs.&rdquo;
Her terror returned. &ldquo;Oh, what is he doing?
He has gone down the passage to Edward&rsquo;s
room. Oh, do you think he&rsquo;s safe? Liz, ring
the bell&mdash;do ring the bell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth shook her head. She came forward
and put her hand on Mary&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Molly, it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; she said. She,
too, listened, but Mary broke in on the silence
with half a sob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how he frightened me. You
don&rsquo;t know how dreadful he was&mdash;like a great
stupid animal. Oh, I don&rsquo;t know how he dared
to come to me like that. And my wrist aches
still, it does, indeed. Oh! Liz, he&rsquo;s coming back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>They heard his steps coming along the passage,
heavy, deliberate steps. Mary moved quickly
away from the door, but Elizabeth stood still, and
David Blake touched her dress as he came back
into the room and shut the door behind him. His
hair was wet from a liberal application of cold
water. His face was less flushed and his eyes had
lost the vacant look. He was obviously making
a very great effort, and as obviously Mary had no
intention of responding to it. She stood and
looked at him, and ceased to be afraid. This was
not the stranger who had frightened her. This
was David Blake again, the man whom she could
play upon, and control. The fright in her eyes
gave place to a dancing spark of anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I asked you to go away,&rdquo; she said,
and David winced at the coldness of her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you please go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want to apologise you can do so later&mdash;when
you are <i>fit</i>,&rdquo; said Mary, her brows arched
over very scornful eyes.</p>
<p>David was still making a great effort at self-control.
He had turned quite white, and his eyes
had rather a dazed look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary, don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said, and there was so
much pain in his voice that Elizabeth made a half
step towards him, and then stopped, because it
was not any comfort of hers that he desired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>Mary&rsquo;s temper was up, and she was not to be
checked. She meant to have her say, and if it
hurt David, why, so much the better. He had
given her a most dreadful fright, and he deserved
to be hurt. It would be very good for him.
Anger reinforced by a high moral motive is indeed
a potent weapon. Mary wielded it unmercifully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Oh, of course
not. You behave disgracefully&mdash;you take advantage
of Edward&rsquo;s being away&mdash;you come here
drunk&mdash;and I&rsquo;m not to say a word&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes sparkled, and her head was high. She
gave a little angry laugh, and turned towards the
bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you go, please, or must I ring for Markham?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At her movement, and the sound of her laughter,
David&rsquo;s self-control gave way, suddenly and completely.
The blood rushed violently to his head.
He took a long step towards her, and she stopped
where she was in sheer terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You laugh,&rdquo; he said, in a low tone of concentrated
passion&mdash;&ldquo;you laugh&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>Then his voice leaped into fury. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sold
my soul for you, and you laugh. I&rsquo;m in hell for
you, and you laugh. I&rsquo;m drunk, and you laugh.
My God, for that at least you shall never laugh at
me again. By God, you shan&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood over her for a moment, looking down
on her with terrible eyes. Then he turned and
went stumbling to the door, and so out, and, in
the dead silence that followed, they heard the
heavy front door swing to behind him.</p>
<p>Mary was clinging to a chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Liz,&rdquo; she whispered faintly, but Elizabeth
turned and went out of the room without
a single word.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>

</div>
<p>Mary did not tell Edward about the scene
with David Blake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, Liz, he behaved shamefully, but
I don&rsquo;t want there to be a quarrel with Edward,
and it would be sure to make a quarrel. And
then people would talk, and there&rsquo;s no knowing
what they would say. I think it would be perfectly
dreadful to be talked about. I&rsquo;m sure I
can&rsquo;t think how Katie Ellerton can stand it.
Really, every one is talking about her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>In her heart of hearts Mary was a little flattered
at David&rsquo;s last outburst. She would not for the
world have admitted that this was the case, but it
certainly contributed to her resolution not to tell
Edward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose some people would never forgive
him,&rdquo; she said to Elizabeth, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t think
that&rsquo;s right, do you? I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s at all
Christian. I don&rsquo;t think one ought to be hard.
He might do something desperate. I saw him go
into Katie Ellerton&rsquo;s only this morning. I think
I&rsquo;ll write him a little note, not referring to anything
of course, and ask him if he won&rsquo;t come in to
supper on Sundays. Then he&rsquo;ll see that I mean
to forgive him, and there won&rsquo;t be any more fuss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sunday appeared to be quite a suitable day
upon which to resume the r&ocirc;le of guardian angel.
Mary felt a pleasant glow of virtue as she wrote
her little note and sent it off to David.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>David Blake did not accept either the invitation
or the olive branch. His anger against Mary was
still stronger than his craving for her presence.
He wrote a polite excuse and sat all that evening
with his eyes fixed upon a book, which he made no
pretence of reading. He had more devils than one
to contend with just now. David had a strong will,
and he was putting the whole strength of it into
fighting the other craving, the craving for drink.
In his sudden heat of passion he had taken an
oath that he meant to keep. He had been drunk,
and Mary had laughed at him. Neither Mary nor
any one else should have that cause for mocking
laughter again, and he sat nightly with a decanter
at his elbow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; as Mrs. Havergill remarked, &ldquo;never
touching a mortal drop,&rdquo; because if he was to
down the devil at all he meant to down him in a
set battle, and not to spend his days in ignominious
flight.</p>
<p>Mrs. Havergill prognosticated woe to Sarah,
with a mournful zest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>&ldquo;Them sudden changes isn&rsquo;t &rsquo;olesome, and I
don&rsquo;t hold with them, Sarah, my girl. One young
man I knew, Maudsley &rsquo;is name was, he got the
&rsquo;orrors, and died a-raving. And all through being
cut off his drink too sudden. He broke &rsquo;is leg, and
&rsquo;is mother, she said, &lsquo;Now I&rsquo;ll break &rsquo;im of the
drink.&rsquo; A very strict Methody woman, were
Jane Ann Maudsley. &lsquo;Now I&rsquo;ll break &rsquo;im,&rsquo; says
she; and there she sits and watches &rsquo;im, and the
pore feller &rsquo;ollering for whisky, just fair &rsquo;ollering.
&lsquo;Gemme a drop, Mother,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;Not I,&rsquo; says
she. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s &rsquo;ell fire, William,&rsquo; says she. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m all
on fire now, Mother,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;Better burn now
than in &rsquo;ell, William,&rsquo; says Jane Ann; and then
the &rsquo;orrors took him, and he died. A fine, proper
young man as ever stepped, and very sweet on me
before I took up with Havergill,&rdquo; concluded Mrs.
Havergill meditatively, whilst Sarah shivered,
and wished, as she afterwards confessed to a friend,
&ldquo;that Mrs. Havergill would be more cheerful like&mdash;just
once in a way, for a change, as it were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For she do fair give a girl the &rsquo;ump sometimes,&rdquo;
concluded Sarah, after what was for her quite a
long speech.</p>
<p>Mrs. Havergill was a very buxom and comely
person of unimpeachable respectability, but her
fund of doleful reminiscence had depressed more
than Sarah. David had been known to complain
of it between jest and earnest. On one such
occasion, at a tea-party to which Mary Chantrey
had inveigled him, Miss Dobell ventured a mild
protest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she is such a treasure. Oh, yes. Your
dear mother always found her so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David winced a little. His mother had not
been dead very long then. He regarded Miss
Dobell with gravity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have always wondered,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;whether it
was an early apprenticeship to a ghoul which has
imparted such a mortuary turn to Mrs. Havergill&rsquo;s
conversation, or whether it is due to the fact of
her having a few drops of Harvey&rsquo;s Sauce in her
veins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harvey&rsquo;s Sauce?&rdquo; inquired the bewildered
Miss Dobell.</p>
<p>David explained in his best professional manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said Harvey&rsquo;s Sauce because it is an old
and cherished belief of mind that the same talented
gentleman invented the sauce and composed the
well-known &lsquo;Meditations among the Tombs.&rsquo;
The only point upon which I feel some uncertainty
is this: Did he compose the Meditations because
the sauce had disagreed with him, or did he invent
the sauce as a sort of cheerful antidote to the
Meditations? Now which do you suppose, Miss
Dobell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Dobell became very much fluttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m afraid&mdash;&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;I really had
no idea that Harvey&rsquo;s Sauce was an unwholesome
condiment. Yes, indeed, I fear that I cannot be
of any great assistance, or in fact of any assistance
at all. No, oh, no. I fear, Dr. Blake, that you
must ask some one else who is better informed
than myself. Oh, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>Afterwards she confided to Mary Chantrey
that she had never heard of the work in question.
&ldquo;Have you, my dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, never,&rdquo; said Mary, who was not greatly
attracted by the title. Girls of two-and-twenty
with a disposition to meditate among the tombs
are mercifully rare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; pursued little Miss Dobell with a virtuous
lift of the chin, &ldquo;the title has a religious
sound&mdash;yes, quite a religious sound. I hope, oh,
yes, indeed, I hope that Dr. Blake has no dreadful
sceptical opinions. They are so very shocking,&rdquo;
and Mary said, &ldquo;Yes, they are, and I hope
not, too.&rdquo; Even in those days she was a little
inclined to play at being David&rsquo;s guardian angel.</p>
<p>Those days were two years old now. Sometimes
it seemed to David that they belonged to
another life.</p>
<p>Meanwhile he had his devil to fight. In the
days that followed he fought the devil, and beat
him, but without either pride or pleasure in the
victory, for, deprived of stimulant, he fell again into
the black pit of depression. Insomnia stood by
his pillow and made the nights longer and more
dreadful than the longest, gloomiest day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>Mary met him in the High Street one day, and
was really shocked at his looks. She reproached
herself for neglecting him, smiled upon him
sweetly, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, David, do come and see us. Edward
will be so pleased. He got a parcel of butterflies
from Java last week, and he would so much like
you to see them. He was saying so only this
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David made a suitable response. His anger was
gone. Mary was Mary. If she were unkind,
she was still Mary. If she were trivial, foolish,
cruel, what did it matter? Her voice made his
blood leap, her eyes were like wine, her hand
played on his pulses, and he asked nothing more
than to feel that soft touch, and answer to it, with
every high-strung nerve. He despised her a
little, and himself a good deal, and when a man&rsquo;s
passion for a woman is mingled with contempt, it
goes but ill with his soul.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>That evening saw him again in his old place.
He came and went as of old, and, as of old, his
fever burned, and burning, fretted away both
health and self-respect. He slept less and less,
and if sleep came at all, it was so thin, so haunted
by ill dreams, that waking was a positive relief.
At least when he waked he was still sane, but in
those dreams there lurked an impending horror
that might at any moment burst the gloom, and
stare him mad. It was madness that he feared in
the days which linked that endless procession of
long, unendurable nights. It was about this time
that he began to be haunted by a strange vision,
which, like the impending terror, lay just beyond
the bounds of consciousness. As on the one side
madness lurked, so on the other there were hints,
stray gleams, as it were, from some place of peace.
And the strange thing about it was, that at these
moments a conviction would seize him that this
place was his by right. His the deep waters of
comfort, and his the wide, unbroken fields of peace,
his&mdash;but lost.</p>
<p>Yet during all this time David went about
his work, and if his patients thought him looking
ill, they had no reason to complain either of inefficiency
or neglect. His work was in itself a
stimulant to him, a stimulant which braced his
nerves and cleared his brain during the time that
he was under its influence, and then resulted,
like all stimulants, in a reaction of fatigue and
nervous strain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>In the first days of March, Elizabeth Chantrey
had a visit from old Dr. Bull. He sat and had tea
with her in her little brown room, and talked about
the mild spring weather and the show of buds
upon the apple tree in his small square of garden.
He also told her that Mrs. Codrington had three
broods of chickens out, a fact of which Elizabeth
had already been informed by Mrs. Codrington
herself. When Dr. Bull had finished dealing with
the early chickens, he asked for another cup of
tea, took a good pull at it, wiped his square beard
with a very brilliant pocket-handkerchief in
which the prevailing colours were sky-blue and
orange, and remarked abruptly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you get David Blake to go away,
hey?&mdash;hey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth frowned a little. This was getting
to close quarters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo; she said, with a note of gentle surprise in
her voice.</p>
<p>Dr. Bull was quite ready for her. &ldquo;You is
the second person plural&mdash;or used to be when I
went to school. You, and Mary, and Edward,
you&rsquo;re his friends, aren&rsquo;t you?&mdash;and two of you
are women, so he&rsquo;ll have to be polite, hey? Can&rsquo;t
bite your heads off the way he bit off mine, when
I suggested that a holiday &rsquo;ud do him good. And
he wants a holiday, hey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;He ought to go away,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll break down if he doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Dr.
Bull. He finished his cup of tea, and held it out.
&ldquo;Yes, another, please. You make him go, and
he&rsquo;ll come back a new man. What&rsquo;s the good
of being a woman if you can&rsquo;t manage a man
for his good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth thought the matter over for an hour,
and then she spoke to Edward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; said Edward, with a good deal
of irritation. &ldquo;I asked him some little time ago
whether he wasn&rsquo;t going to take a holiday. Now
what is there in that to put any one&rsquo;s back up?
And yet, I do assure you, he looked at me as if
I had insulted him. Really, Elizabeth, I can&rsquo;t
make out what has happened to David. He
never used to be like this. And he comes here too
often, a great deal too often. I shall have to tell
him so, and then there&rsquo;ll be a row, and I simply
hate rows. But really, a man in his state,
always under one&rsquo;s feet&mdash;it gets on one&rsquo;s
nerves.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;Edward is getting dreadfully put out,&rdquo; said
Mary the same evening. She had come down to
Elizabeth&rsquo;s room to borrow a book, and lingered
for a moment or two, standing by the fire and
holding one foot to the blaze. It was a night of
sudden frost after the mild spring day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How cold it has turned,&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;Yes,
I really don&rsquo;t know what to do. If Edward goes
on being tiresome and jealous&rdquo;&mdash;she bridled a
little as she spoke&mdash;&ldquo;if he goes on&mdash;well, David
will just have to stay away, and I&rsquo;m afraid he will
feel it. I am afraid it may be bad for him. You
know I have always hoped that I was being of
some use to David&mdash;I have always wanted to
have an influence&mdash;a good influence does make
such a difference, doesn&rsquo;t it? I&rsquo;ve never flirted
with David&mdash;I really haven&rsquo;t&mdash;you know that,
Liz?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Elizabeth slowly. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t
flirted with him, Molly, my dear, but I think you
are in rather a difficult position for being a good
influence. You see, David is in love with you,
and I think it would be better for him if he didn&rsquo;t
see you quite so often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary&rsquo;s colour rose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help his being&mdash;fond of me,&rdquo; she said,
with a slight air of offended virtue. &ldquo;I am sure
I don&rsquo;t know what you mean by my not being
good for him. If it weren&rsquo;t for me he might be
drinking himself to death at this very moment.
You know how he was going on, and I am sure
you can&rsquo;t have forgotten how dreadful he was that
night he came here. I let him see how shocked
I was. I know you were angry with me, and I
thought it very unreasonable of you, because I
did it on purpose, and it stopped him. You may
say what you like, Liz, but it stopped him. Mrs.
Havergill told Markham&mdash;yes, I know you don&rsquo;t
think I ought to talk to Markham about David,
but she began about it herself, and she is really
interested, and thought I would like to know&mdash;well,
she says David has never touched a drop
since. Mrs. Havergill told her so. So you see,
Liz, I haven&rsquo;t always been as bad for David as
you seem to think. I don&rsquo;t know if you want
him to go and marry Katie Ellerton, just out of
pique. She&rsquo;s running after him worse than ever&mdash;I
really do wonder she isn&rsquo;t ashamed, and if
David&rsquo;s friends cast him off, well, she&rsquo;ll just snap
him up, and then I should think you&rsquo;d be sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>Elizabeth leaned her chin in her hand, and was
silent for a moment. Then she said: &ldquo;Molly, dear,
why should we try and prevent David from going
to see Katie Ellerton? He is in love with you,
and it is very bad for him. If he saw less of you
for a time it would give him a chance of getting
over it. David is very unhappy just now. No
one can fail to see that. He wants what you can&rsquo;t
give him&mdash;rest, companionship, a home. If Katie
cares for him, and can give him these things, let
her give them. We have no business to stand in
the way. Don&rsquo;t you see that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth spoke sweetly and persuasively. She
kept her eyes on her sister&rsquo;s face, and saw there,
first, offence, and then interest&mdash;the birth of a
new idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well&mdash;if you don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; said Mary.
&ldquo;You are nearly as tiresome as Edward and Edward
has been most dreadfully tiresome. I told
him so. I said, &lsquo;Edward, I really never knew you
could be so tiresome,&rsquo; and it seemed to make him
<i>worse</i>. I think, you know, that he is afraid that
people will talk if David goes on coming here. Of
course, that&rsquo;s absurd, I told him it was absurd. I
said, &lsquo;Why, how on earth is any one to know that
it isn&rsquo;t Elizabeth he comes to see?&rsquo; And then,
Edward became really violent. I didn&rsquo;t know he
could be, but he was. He simply plunged up
and down the room, and said: &lsquo;If he wants to see
Elizabeth, then in Heaven&rsquo;s name let him see
Elizabeth. Let him <i>marry</i> Elizabeth.&rsquo; Oh, you
mustn&rsquo;t mind, Liz,&rdquo; as Elizabeth&rsquo;s head went up,
&ldquo;it was only because he was so cross, and you and
David are such old friends. There&rsquo;s nothing for
you to <i>mind</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>She paused, stole a quick glance at Elizabeth,
then looked away, and said in a tentative voice,
&ldquo;Liz, why don&rsquo;t you marry David?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he doesn&rsquo;t want me to, Molly,&rdquo;
said Elizabeth. Her voice was very proud, and
her head very high.</p>
<p>Mary half put out her hand, and drew it back
again. She knew this mood of Elizabeth&rsquo;s, and
it was one that silenced even her ready tongue.
She was the little sister again for a moment, and
Elizabeth the mother, sister, and ideal&mdash;all in one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Liz, I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she said in quite a small,
humble voice.</p>
<p>When she had gone, Elizabeth sat on by the
fire. She did not move for a long time. When
she did move, it was to put up a hand to her face,
which was wet with many hot, slow tears. Pride
dies hard, and hurts to the very last.</p>

</div>
<p>It was on an afternoon, a few days later, that
David came into the hall of the Mottisfonts&rsquo;
house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord save us, he do look bad,&rdquo; was the
thought in Markham&rsquo;s mind as she let him in.
Aloud she said that she thought Mrs. Mottisfont
was just going out. As she spoke, Mary came
down the stairs, bringing with her a sweet scent
of violets.</p>
<p>Mary was very obviously going out. She wore
a white cloth dress, with dark furs, and there was
a large bunch of mauve and white violets at her
breast. She looked a little vexed when she saw
David.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am just going out. I am
so sorry, but I am afraid I must. Bazaars are
tiresome things, but one must go to them, and
I promised Mrs. Codrington that I would be
there early. Elizabeth is in. She&rsquo;ll give you
some tea. Markham, will you please tell Miss
Elizabeth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>David came forward as she was speaking.
There was a window above the front door, and as
he came out of the shadow, and the light fell
on his face, he saw Mary start a little. Her
expression changed, and she said in a hesitating
manner:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, Elizabeth may be busy, or she may
be going out&mdash;I really don&rsquo;t know. Perhaps you
had better come another day, David.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He read her clearly enough. She thought that
he had been drinking, and hesitated to leave him
with her sister. He had been about to say that he
could not stop, but her suspicion raised a devil of
obstinacy in him, and as Elizabeth came out of her
room by way of the dining-room, he advanced to
meet her, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you give me some tea, Elizabeth, or are
you too busy?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>&ldquo;Liz, come here,&rdquo; said Mary quickly. Her
colour had risen at David&rsquo;s tone. She drew
Elizabeth a little aside. &ldquo;Liz, you&rsquo;d better not,&rdquo;
she whispered, &ldquo;he looks so queer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Molly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Molly, are you going to begin to
chaperone me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary tossed her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if you don&rsquo;t <i>mind</i>,&rdquo; she said angrily, and
went out, leaving Elizabeth with an odd sense of
anticipation.</p>
<p>Elizabeth found David standing before the
writing-table, and looking at himself in the little
Dutch mirror which hung above it. He turned
as she came in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said bitterly, &ldquo;has Mary renounced
the Bazaar in order to stay and protect you?
I&rsquo;m not really as dangerous as she seems to think,
though I am willing to admit that I am not exactly
ornamental. Give me some tea, and I&rsquo;ll not
inflict myself on you for long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth smiled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>&ldquo;You know very well that I like having you
here,&rdquo; she said in her friendly voice. &ldquo;Look at
my flowers. Aren&rsquo;t they well forward? I really
think that everything is a fortnight before its
time this year. No, not that chair, David. This
one is much more comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Markham was coming in with the tea as Elizabeth
spoke. David sat silent. He watched the
tiny flame of the spirit-lamp, the mingled flicker
of firelight and daylight upon the silver, and the
thin old china with its branching pattern of purple
and yellow flowers. He drank as many cups of
tea as Elizabeth gave him, and she talked a little
in a desultory manner, until he had finished, and
then sat in a silence that was not awkward, but
companionable.</p>
<p>David made no effort to move, or speak. This
was a pleasant room of Elizabeth&rsquo;s. The brown
panels were warm in the firelight. They made a
soft darkness that had nothing gloomy about it,
and the room was full of flowers. The great brown
crock full of daffodils stood on the window-ledge,
and on the table which filled the angle between the
window and the fireplace was another, in which
stood a number of the tall yellow tulips which
smell like Mar&eacute;chal-Niel roses. Elizabeth&rsquo;s dress
was brown, too. It was made of some soft stuff
that made no sound when she moved. The room
was very still, and very sweet, and the sweetness
and the stillness were very grateful to David
Blake. The thought came to him suddenly, that
it was many years since he had sat like this
in Elizabeth&rsquo;s room, and the silence had companioned
them. Years ago he had been there
often enough, and they had talked, read, argued,
or been still, just as the spirit of the moment
dictated. They had been good comrades, then,
in the old days&mdash;the happy days of youth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>He looked across at Elizabeth and said
suddenly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a very restful woman, Elizabeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled at him without moving, and
answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad if I rest you, David&mdash;I think you
need rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sit so still. No one else sits so still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth laughed softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds as if I were a very inert sort of
person,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>David frowned a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not that. It is strength&mdash;force&mdash;stability.
Only strong things keep still like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was so like the old David, that it took
Elizabeth back ten years at a leap. She was
silent for a moment, gathering her courage. Then
she said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>&ldquo;David, you do need rest, and a change. Why
don&rsquo;t you go away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had thought he would be angry, but he
was not angry. Instead, he answered her as the
David of ten years ago might have done, with
a misquotation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the good of a change? It&rsquo;s a case
of&mdash;I myself am my own Heaven and Hell&rdquo;;
and his voice was the voice of a very weary
man.</p>
<p>Elizabeth&rsquo;s eyes dwelt on him with a deep considering
look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;One has to
find oneself. But it is easier to find oneself in
clear country than in a fog. This place is not
good for you, David. When I said you wanted
a change, I didn&rsquo;t mean just for a time&mdash;I
meant altogether. Why don&rsquo;t you go right
away&mdash;leave it all behind you, and start
again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her as if he might be angry, if he
were not too tired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I won&rsquo;t run away,&rdquo; he said, with his
voice back on the harsh note which had become
habitual.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>There was a pause. Elizabeth heard her own
heart beat. The room was getting darker. A
log fell in the fire.</p>
<p>Then David laughed bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounded very fine, but it&rsquo;s just a flam.
The truth is, not that I won&rsquo;t run away, but that
I can&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve not got the energy. I&rsquo;m three
parts broke, and it&rsquo;s all I can do to keep going at
all. I couldn&rsquo;t start fresh, because I&rsquo;ve got nothing
to start with. If I could sleep for a week it
would give me a chance, but I can&rsquo;t sleep. Skeffington
has taken me in hand now, and out of
three drugs he has given me, two made me feel
as if I were going mad, and the third had no effect
at all. I&rsquo;m full of bromide now. It makes me
sleepy, but it doesn&rsquo;t make me sleep. You
don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like. My brain is drunk
with sleep&mdash;marshy with it, water-logged&mdash;but
there&rsquo;s always one point of consciousness left
high and dry&mdash;tortured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you sleep at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I do, or I should be mad in real
earnest. Do I look mad, Elizabeth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him. His face was very white,
except for a flushed patch high up on either cheek.
His eyes were bloodshot and strained, but there
was no madness in them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is that what you are afraid of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my God, yes,&rdquo; said David Blake, speaking
only just above his breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you need be afraid. I don&rsquo;t,
really, David. You look very tired. You look
as if you wanted sleep more than anything else in
the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke very gently. &ldquo;Will you let me send
you to sleep? I think I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does one ask a man who is dying of thirst if
one may give him a drink?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I may?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo; He broke off as Markham
came in to clear away the tea. Elizabeth
began to talk of trivialities. For a minute or two
Markham came and went, but when she had taken
away the tray, and the door was shut, there was
silence again.</p>
<p>Elizabeth had turned her chair a little. She
sat looking into the fire. She was not making
pictures among the embers, as she sometimes
did. Her eyes had a brooding look. Her honey-coloured
hair looked like pale gold against the
brown panelling behind her. She sat very still.
David found it pleasant to watch her, pleasant to
be here.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>His whole head was stiff and numb with lack of
sleep. Every muscle seemed stretched and every
nerve taut. There was a dull, continuous pain at
the back of his head. Thought seemed muffled,
his faculties clogged. Two thirds of his brain
was submerged, but in the remaining third consciousness
flared like a flickering will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp
above a marsh.</p>
<p>David lay back in his chair. This was a peaceful
place, a peaceful room. He had not meant to
stay so long, but he had no desire to move. Slowly,
slowly the tide of sleep mounted in him. Not, as
often lately, with a sudden flooding wave which
retreated again as suddenly, and left his brain
reeling, but steadily, quietly, like the still rising
of some peaceful, moon-drawn sea. He seemed
to see that lifting tide. It was as deep and still as
those still waters of which another David wrote.
It rose and rose&mdash;the will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp of consciousness
ceased its tormented flickering, and he slept.</p>
<p>Elizabeth never turned her head. She heard
his breathing deepen, until it was very slow and
steady. There was no other sound except when
an ember dropped. The light failed. Soon there
was no light but the glow of the fire.</p>

<p>David slept for a couple of hours, and that
night he slept more than he had done for
weeks. Next night, however, there returned the
old strain, the old yearning for oblivion, the old
inability to compass it. In the week that followed
David passed through a number of strange, mental
phases. After that first sound sleep had relieved
the tension of his brain, he told himself that he
owed it to the delayed action of the bromide
Skeffington had given him. But as the strain
returned, though reason held him to this opinion
still, out of the deep undercurrents of consciousness
there rose before him a vision of Elizabeth,
with the gift of sleep in her hand. He passed into
a state of conflict, and out of this conflict there
grew up a pride that would owe nothing to a
woman, a resistance that called itself reason and
independence. And then, as the desire for sleep
dominated everything, conflict merged into a desire
that Elizabeth should heal him, should make
him sleep. And all through the week he did not
think of Mary at all. The craving for her had
been swallowed up by that other craving. Mary
had raised this fever, but it had now reached a
point at which he had become unconscious of her.
It was Elizabeth who filled his thoughts. Not
Elizabeth the woman, but Elizabeth the bearer
of that gift of sleep. But this, too, was a phase,
and had its reaction.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the week he finished his
afternoon round by going to see an old Irishwoman,
who had been in the hospital for an operation,
and had since been dismissed as incurable.
She was a plucky old soul, and a cheerful, but to-day
David found her in a downcast mood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, it&rsquo;s not the pain I&rsquo;d be minding if I
could get my sleep,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t ye
be after putting the least taste of something in
my medicine, then, Doctor, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>David had his finger on her pulse. He patted
her hand kindly as he laid it down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, now, Mrs. Halloran,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when
I gave you that last bottle of medicine you said
it made you sleep beautifully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just for a bit it did,&rdquo; said Judy Halloran.
&ldquo;Sure, it was only for a bit, and now it&rsquo;s the
devil&rsquo;s own nights I&rsquo;m having. Couldn&rsquo;t you be
making it the least taste stronger, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at David rather piteously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we must see,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You finish
that bottle, and then I&rsquo;ll see what I can do for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Halloran closed her eyes for a minute.
Then she opened them rather suddenly, shot a
quick look at David, and said with an eager note
in her voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do be saying that Miss Chantrey can
make anny one sleep. There was a friend of mine
was after telling me about it. It was her daughter
that had the sleep gone from her, and after Miss
Chantrey came to see her, it was the fine nights
she was having, and it&rsquo;s the strong woman she
is now, entirely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David got up rather abruptly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come, now, Mrs. Halloran,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you
know as well as I do that that&rsquo;s all nonsense. But
I daresay a visit from Miss Chantrey would cheer
you up quite a lot. Would you like to see her?
Shall I ask her to come in one day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d be kindly welcome,&rdquo; said Judy Halloran.</p>
<p>David went home with the old conflict raging
again. Skeffington had been urging him to see a
specialist. He had always refused. But now,
quite suddenly, he wired for an appointment.</p>
<p>He came down from town on a dark, rainy afternoon,
feeling that he had built up a barrier between
himself and superstition.</p>
<p>An hour later he was at the Mottisfonts&rsquo; door,
asking Markham if Mary was at home. Mary
had gone out to tea, said Markham, and then
volunteered, &ldquo;Miss Elizabeth is in, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David told himself that he had not intended
to ask for Elizabeth. Why should he ask for
Elizabeth? He could, however, hardly explain to
Markham that it was not Elizabeth he wished to
see, so he came in, and was somehow very glad
to come.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>Elizabeth had been reading aloud to herself.
As he stood at the door he could hear the rise and
fall of her voice. It was an old trick of hers.
Ten years ago he had often stood on the threshold
and listened, until rebuked by Elizabeth for
eavesdropping.</p>
<p>He came in, and she said just in the old voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were listening, David.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it was the David of to-day who responded
wearily, &ldquo;I beg your pardon, Elizabeth. Did
you mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not. Sit down, David. What
have you been doing with yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of sitting down he walked to the window
and looked out. The sky was one even grey,
and, though the rain had ceased, heavy drops
were falling from the roof and denting the earth
in Elizabeth&rsquo;s window boxes, which were full of
daffodils in bud. After a moment he turned
and said impatiently, &ldquo;How dark this room is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth divined in him a reaction, a fear of
what she had done, and might do. She knew
very well why he had stayed away. Without
replying she put out her hand and touched a
switch on the wall. A tall lamp with a yellow
shade sprang into view, and the whole room became
filled with a soft, warm light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>David left the window, but still he did not sit.
For a while he walked up and down restlessly,
but at length came to a standstill between Elizabeth
and the fire. He was so close to her that she
had only to put out her hand and it would have
touched his. He stood looking, now at the miniatures
on the wall, now at the fire which burned
with a steady red glow. He was half turned
from Elizabeth, but she could see his face. It
was strained and thin. The flesh had fallen
away, leaving the great bones prominent.</p>
<p>It was Elizabeth who broke the silence, and
she said what she had not meant to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;David, are you better? Are you sleeping?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you won&rsquo;t let me help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you think I didn&rsquo;t know?&rdquo; Elizabeth&rsquo;s
voice was very sad.</p>
<p>They had fallen suddenly upon an intimate note.
It was a note that he had never touched with
Mary. That they should be talking like this
filled him with a dazed surprise. He as well as
she was taking it for granted that she had given
him sleep, and could give him sleep again.</p>
<p>He gave himself a sudden shake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going away,&rdquo; he said in a harder
voice.</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, and then there
was silence again.</p>
<p>This time it was David who spoke, and he
spoke in the hot, insistent tones of a man who
argues a losing case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One can&rsquo;t go on not sleeping. That is what
I said to old Wyatt Byng to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Wyatt Byng?&rdquo; said Elizabeth quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I saw him. Skeffington would have me
see him, but what&rsquo;s the use? He swears I shall
sleep, if I take the stuff he&rsquo;s given me&mdash;the latest
French fad&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t sleep. I seem to have
lost the way&mdash;and one can&rsquo;t go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused, and then said frowning:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so odd&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Odd?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;so odd&mdash;sleep. Such an odd thing. It
was so easy once. Now it&rsquo;s so difficult that it
can&rsquo;t be done. Why? No one knows. No
one knows what sleep is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice trailed away. He was strung like a
wire that is ready to snap, and on the borders of
consciousness, just out of sight, something waited;
he turned his head sharply, as if the thing he
dreaded might be there&mdash;behind him&mdash;in the
shadow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>Instead, he saw Elizabeth in a golden light like
a halo. It swam before his tired eyes, a glow with
a rainbow edge. Out of the heart of it she looked
at him with serious, tender eyes.</p>
<p>Beyond, in the gloom, there lurked such a
horror as made him catch his breath, and here at
his side&mdash;in this room, peace, safety, and sleep&mdash;sleep,
the one thing in heaven or earth desired
and desirable.</p>
<p>A sort of shudder passed over him, and he
repeated his own last words in a low, altered voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One <i>can&rsquo;t</i> go on. Something must give way.
Sometimes I feel as if it might give now&mdash;at any
moment. Then there&rsquo;s madness&mdash;when one can&rsquo;t
sleep. Am I going mad, Elizabeth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth caught his hand and held it. He was
so near that the impulse carried her away. Her
clasp was strong, warm, and vital.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my dear, no,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Then with a catch in her voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, David&mdash;let me help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head in a slow, considering
manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;there would be only one way&mdash;and that&rsquo;s
not fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What isn&rsquo;t fair, David?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;to marry&mdash;me,&rdquo; he said, still in that
slow, considering way. &ldquo;You know, Elizabeth,
I can&rsquo;t think very well. My head is all to pieces.
But it&rsquo;s not fair, and I can&rsquo;t take your help&mdash;&rdquo;
He broke off frowning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;David, it has nothing to do with that sort of
thing,&rdquo; said Elizabeth very seriously. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
only what I would do for any one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was shaken to the depths, but she kept her
voice low and steady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;it has&mdash;one can&rsquo;t take like that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m a woman? Just because I&rsquo;m
a woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth looked up quickly and spoke quickly,
because she knew that if she stopped to think she
would not speak at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if we were married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it would be different,&rdquo; said David Blake.</p>
<p>His voice was not like his usual voice. It
sounded like the voice of a man who was puzzled,
who was trying to recall something of which he
has seen glimpses. Was it something from the
past, or something from the future?</p>
<p>Elizabeth got up and stood as he was standing&mdash;one
hand on the oak shelf above the fireplace
the other clenched at her side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>&ldquo;David, are you asking me to marry you?&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<p>He raised his head, half startled. The silence
that followed her question seemed to fill the room
and shake it. His will shook too, drawn this way
and that by forces that were above and beyond
them both.</p>
<p>Elizabeth did not look at him. She did not
know what he would answer, and all their lives
hung on that answer of his. She held her breath,
and it seemed to her that she was holding her
will too. She was suddenly, overpoweringly conscious
of her own strength, her own vital force
and power. If she let this force go out to David
now&mdash;in his weakness! It was the greatest temptation
that she had ever known, and, after one
shuddering moment, she turned from it in horror.
She kept her will, her strength, her vital powers in
a strong grip. No influence of hers must touch or
sway him now. Her heart stopped beating. Her
very life seemed to be suspended. Then she heard
David say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you marry me, Elizabeth?&rdquo; His tone
was a wondering one. It broke the tension. She
turned her head a little and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;if you needed me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>&ldquo;Need&mdash;need&mdash;I think I should sleep&mdash;and if
I don&rsquo;t sleep I shall go mad. But, perhaps I shall
go mad anyhow. You must not marry me if I
am going mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t go mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think not? There is something that
shakes all the time. It never stops. It goes on
always. I think that is why I don&rsquo;t sleep. But
when I am with you it seems to stop. I don&rsquo;t
know why, but it does seem to stop, just whilst I
am with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will stop altogether when you get your
sleep back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The half-dreamy note went out of his voice,
and the note of intimate self-revealing. Elizabeth
noticed the change at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do you go away, and where do you go?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Switzerland, I think. I could get away by
the 3rd of April.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>David was trying to think, but his head was
very tired. He must go away. He must have a
change. They all said that. But it was no use
for him to go away if he did not sleep. He must
have sleep. But if Elizabeth were with him he
would sleep. Elizabeth must come with him. If
they were married at once she could come with
him, and then he would sleep. But it was so soon.
He spoke his thought aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t marry me first, I suppose?
You wouldn&rsquo;t come with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said Elizabeth quietly. The
quietness hid the greatest effort of her life. &ldquo;If
you want me, I will come. I only want to help
you, and if I can help you best that way&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>David let himself sink into a chair, and began to
talk a little of plans, wearily and with an effort.
He had to force his brain to make it work at all.
All these details, these plans, these conventions
seemed to him irrelevant and burdensome.</p>
<p>He got up to go as the clock struck seven.</p>
<p>Elizabeth put out her hand to him as she had
always done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you will let me help you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not yet&mdash;not till afterwards,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It makes no difference, David, you know.
It is just what I would do for any one who wanted
it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head. There was a reaction upon
him, a withdrawal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet&mdash;not till afterwards. I&rsquo;ll give
old Byng&rsquo;s stuff a chance,&rdquo; he said obstinately,
and then went out with just a bare good-night.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>Edward was, perhaps, the person best pleased
at the news of Elizabeth&rsquo;s engagement. He
had been, as Mary phrased it, &ldquo;very much put
out.&rdquo; Put out, in fact, to the point of wondering
whether he could possibly nerve himself to tell
David that he came too often to the house. He
had an affection for David, and he was under an
obligation to him, but there were limits&mdash;during
the last fortnight he had very frequently explained
to Mary that there were limits. Whether he
would ever have got as far as explaining this to
David remains amongst the lesser mysteries of
life. Mary did not take the explanation in what
Edward considered at all a proper spirit. She
bridled, looked very pretty, talked about good
influences, and was much offended when Edward
lost his temper. He lost it to the extent of consigning
good influences to a place with which they
are not usually connected, though the way to it is
said to be paved with good intentions. Mary had
a temper, too. It took her out of the room with a
bang of the door, but she subsequently cried herself
sick because Edward had sworn at her.</p>
<p>There was a reconciliation, but Edward was not
as penitent as Mary thought he should have been.
David became a sore point with both of them, and
Edward, at least, was unfeignedly pleased at what
he considered a happy solution of the difficulty.
He was fond of Elizabeth, but it would certainly
be more agreeable to have the whole house at his
own disposal. He had always thought that Elizabeth&rsquo;s
little brown room would be the very place
for his collections. He fell to estimating the
probable cost of lining the whole wall-space with
cabinets.</p>
<p>Mary was not quite as pleased as Edward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>&ldquo;You know, Liz,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am very <i>glad</i>
that David should marry. I think he wants a
home. But I don&rsquo;t think you ought to marry him
until he&rsquo;s <i>better</i>. He looks dreadful. And a
fortnight&rsquo;s engagement&mdash;I can&rsquo;t <i>think</i> what people
will say&mdash;one ought to consider that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Molly, you are too young for the part of
Mrs. Grundy,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, laughing.</p>
<p>Mary coloured and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well, Liz, but people will talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Molly, and if they do? What is there
for them to say? It is all very simple, really.
No one can help seeing how ill David is, and I think
every one would understand my wanting to be
with him. People are really quite human and
understanding if they are taken the right way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But a fortnight,&rdquo; said Mary, frowning. &ldquo;Why
Liz, you will not be able to get your things!&rdquo;
And she was shocked beyond words when Elizabeth
betrayed a complete indifference as to
whether she had any new things at all.</p>
<p>The wedding was fixed for the 3rd of April, and
the days passed. David made the necessary
arrangements with a growing sense of detachment.
The matter was out of his hands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>For a week the new drug gave him sleep, a sleep
full of brilliant dreams, strange flashes of light,
and bursts of unbearable colour. He woke from
it with a blinding headache and a sense of strain
beyond that induced by insomnia. Towards the
end of the week he stopped taking the drug. The
headache had become unendurable. This state
was worse than the last.</p>
<p>On the last day of March he came to Elizabeth
and told her that their marriage must be
deferred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ronnie Ellerton is very ill,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
go away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But David, you <i>must</i>&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head. The obstinacy of illness
was upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t&mdash;and I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he declared. Then,
as if realising that he owed her some explanation,
he added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s so spoilt. Why are women such fools?
He&rsquo;s never been made to do anything he didn&rsquo;t
like. He won&rsquo;t take food or medicine, and I&rsquo;m
the only person who has the least authority over
him. And she&rsquo;s half crazy with anxiety, poor
soul. I have promised not to go until he&rsquo;s round
the corner. It&rsquo;s only a matter of a day or two,
so we must just put it off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth put her hand on his arm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>&ldquo;David, we need not put off the marriage,&rdquo;
she said in her most ordinary tones. &ldquo;You see,
if we are married, we could start off as soon as
the child was better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had it in her mind that unless David would
let her help him soon, he would be past helping.</p>
<p>He looked at her indifferently. &ldquo;You will stay
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not unless you wish,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I? Oh! it is for you to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no interest in his tone. If he thought
of anything it was of Ronnie Ellerton. A complete
apathy had descended upon him. Nothing
was real, nothing mattered. Health&mdash;sanity&mdash;rest&mdash;these
were only names. They meant nothing.
Only when he turned to his work, his
brain still moved with the precision of a machine,
regularly, correctly.</p>
<p>He did not tell her either then or ever, that
Katie Ellerton had broken down and spoken
bitter words about his marriage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve nothing but Ronnie&mdash;nothing but Ronnie&mdash;and
you will go away with her and he will die.
I know he will die if you go. Can&rsquo;t she spare
you just for two days&mdash;or three&mdash;to save Ronnie&rsquo;s
life? Promise me you won&rsquo;t go till he is safe&mdash;promise&mdash;promise.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>And David had promised, taking in what she
had said about the child, but only half grasping
the import of her frantic appeal. Neither he nor
she were real people to him just now. Only
Ronnie was real&mdash;Ronnie, who was ill, and his
patient.</p>
<p>Elizabeth went through the next two days with
a heavy heart. She had to meet Mary&rsquo;s questions,
her objections, her disapprobations, and it
was all just a little more than she could bear.</p>
<p>On the night before the wedding, Mary left
Edward upstairs and came to sit beside Elizabeth&rsquo;s
fire. Elizabeth would rather have been alone, and
yet she was pleased that Mary cared to come. If
only she would let all vexed questions be&mdash;it
seemed as if she would, for her mood was a silent
one. She sat for a long time without speaking,
then, with an impulsive movement, she slid out of
her chair and knelt at Elizabeth&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Liz, I&rsquo;ve been cross. I know I have. I
know you&rsquo;ve thought me cross. But it&rsquo;s because
I&rsquo;ve been unhappy&mdash;Liz, I&rsquo;m not <i>happy</i> about
you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth put her hand on Mary&rsquo;s shoulder for
a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be unhappy, Molly,&rdquo; she said, in rather
an unsteady voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I am, Liz, I am&mdash;I can&rsquo;t help it&mdash;I have
talked, and worried you, and have been cross,
but all the time I&rsquo;ve been most dreadfully
unhappy. Oh, Liz, don&rsquo;t do it&mdash;don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Molly, dear&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I know it&rsquo;s no use&mdash;you won&rsquo;t listen&mdash;&rdquo;
and Mary drew away and dabbed her eyes with a
fragmentary apology for a pocket-handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Molly, please&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Liz, I know. I won&rsquo;t&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t mean
to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a little silence. Then with a sudden
choking sob, Mary turned and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t <i>bear</i> it. Oh, Liz, you ought to be loved
so much. You ought to marry some one who loves
you&mdash;<i>really</i>&mdash;&mdash;. And I don&rsquo;t think David does.
Liz, does he love you&mdash;does he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sound of her own words frightened her a
little, but Elizabeth answered very gently and sadly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Molly, but he needs me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary was silenced. Here was something beyond
her. She put her arms round Elizabeth
and held her very tightly for a moment. Then
she released her with a sob, and ran crying from
the room.</p>

<p>David Blake was married to Elizabeth
Chantrey at half-past two of an April day.
Edward and Mary Mottisfont were the only
witnesses, with the exception of the verger, who
considered himself a most important person on
these occasions, when he invariably appeared to
be more priestly than the rector and more indispensable
than the bridegroom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>It requires no practice to be a bridegroom but
years, if not generations, go to the making of the
perfect verger. This verger was the son and the
grandson of vergers. He was the perfect verger.
He stood during the service and disapproved of
David&rsquo;s grey pallor, his shaking hand, and his
unsteady voice. His black gown imparted a
funerary air to the proceedings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drinking, that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;d been,&rdquo; he told his
wife, and his wife said, &ldquo;Oh, William,&rdquo; as one who
makes response to an officiating priest.</p>
<p>But he wronged David, who was not drunk&mdash;only
starved for lack of sleep, and strung
to the breaking point. His voice stumbled over
the words in which he took Elizabeth to be his
wedded wife and trailed away to a whisper at the
conclusion.</p>
<p>A gusty wind beat against the long grey windows,
and between the gusts the heavy rain
thudded on the roof above.</p>
<p>Mary shivered in the vestry as she kissed
Elizabeth and wished her joy. Then she turned
to David and kissed him too. He was her brother
now, and there would be no more nonsense. Edward
frowned, David stiffened, and Elizabeth,
standing near him, was aware that all his muscles
had become rigid.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>Elizabeth and David went out by the vestry
door, and stood a moment on the step. The rain
had ceased quite suddenly in the April fashion.
The sky was very black overhead and the air was
full of a wet wind, but far down to the right the
water meadows lay bathed in a clear sweet sunshine,
and the west was as blue as a turquoise.
Between the blue of the sky and the bright emerald
of the grass, the horizon showed faintly golden,
and a broken patch of rainbow light glowed against
the nearest dark cloud.</p>
<p>David and Elizabeth walked to their home in
silence. Mrs. Havergill awaited them with an
air of mournful importance. She had prepared
coffee and a cake with much almond icing and
the word &ldquo;Welcome&rdquo; inscribed upon it in silver
comfits. Elizabeth ate a piece of cake from a sense
of duty, and David drank cup after cup of black
coffee, and then sat in a sort of stupor of fatigue
until roused by the sound of the telephone bell.</p>
<p>After a minute or two he came back into the
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ronnie is worse,&rdquo; he said shortly. There was
a change in him. He had pulled himself together.
His voice was stronger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s worse. I must go at once. Don&rsquo;t
wait dinner, and don&rsquo;t sit up. I may have to
stay all night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he had gone, Elizabeth went upstairs to
unpack. Mrs. Havergill followed her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>&ldquo;You &rsquo;avn&rsquo;t been in this room since Mrs.
Blake was took.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very nice room,&rdquo; said Elizabeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this furniture,&rdquo; said Mrs. Havergill, &ldquo;come
out of the &rsquo;ouse in the &rsquo;Igh Street. That old
mahogany press, Mrs. Blake set a lot of store by,
and the bed, too. Ah! pore thing, I suppose she
little thought as &rsquo;ow she&rsquo;d come to die in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bed was a fine old four-poster, with a
carved foot-rail. Elizabeth went past it to the
windows, of which there were three, set casement
fashion, at the end of the room, with a wide low
window-seat running beneath them.</p>
<p>She got rid of Mrs. Havergill without hurting her
feelings. Then she knelt on the seat, and looked
out. She saw the river beneath her, and a line of
trees in the first green mist of their new leaves.
The river was dark and bright in patches, and the
wind sang above it. Elizabeth&rsquo;s heart was glad
of this place. It was a thing she loved&mdash;to see
green trees and bright water, and to hear the wind
go by above the stream.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>When she had unpacked and put everything
away, she stood for a moment, and then opened
the door that led through into David&rsquo;s room. It
was getting dark in here, for the room faced the
east. Elizabeth went to the window and looked
out. The sky was full of clouds, and the promise
of rain.</p>
<p>It was very late before David came home. At
ten, Elizabeth sent the servants to bed. There
was cold supper laid in the dining-room, and
soup in a covered pan by the side of the fire.
Elizabeth sat by the lamp and sewed. Every now
and then she lifted her head and listened. Then
she sewed again.</p>
<p>At twelve o&rsquo;clock David put his key into the
latch, and the door opened with a little click and
then shut again.</p>
<p>David was a long time coming in. He came in
slowly, and sat down upon the first chair he
touched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; he said in an exhausted voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad,&rdquo; said Elizabeth.</p>
<p>She knelt by the fire, and poured some of the
soup into a cup. Then she held it out to him, and
he drank, taking long draughts. After that she
put food before him, and he ate in a dazed,
mechanical fashion.</p>
<p>When he had finished, he sat staring at Elizabeth,
with his elbows on the table, and his head
between his hands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ronnie is asleep&mdash;he&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo; And then with
sudden passion: &ldquo;My God, if I could sleep!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will, David,&rdquo; said Elizabeth. She put
her hand on his arm, and he turned his head a
little, still staring at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t sleep,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Everything
else sleeps&mdash;<i>Die V&ouml;glein ruhen im Walde</i>. How
does it go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Warte nur, balde ruhest du auch</i>,&rdquo; said Elizabeth
in her tranquil voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said David, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get in. It was so
easy once&mdash;but now I can&rsquo;t get in. The silent
city of sleep has long, smooth walls&mdash;I can&rsquo;t find
the gate; I grope along the wall all night, hour
after hour. A hundred times I think I have found
the door. Sometimes there is a flashing sword
that bars the way, sometimes the wall closes&mdash;closes
as I pass the threshold. There&rsquo;s no way in.
The walls are smooth&mdash;all smooth&mdash;you can&rsquo;t get
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke, not wildly, but in a low, muttering
way. Elizabeth touched his hand. It was very
hot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come, David,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it is late.&rdquo; She
drew him to his feet, and he walked uncertainly,
and leaned on her shoulder, as they went up the
stair. Once in his room, he sank again upon a
chair. He let her help him, but when she knelt,
and would have unlaced his boots, he roused
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you are not to,&rdquo; he said with a sudden
anger in his voice, and he took them off, and then
let her help him again.</p>
<p>When he was in bed, Elizabeth stood by him for
a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you comfortable?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I could sleep,&rdquo; he said, only just above
his breath. &ldquo;If I could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but you will,&rdquo; said Elizabeth. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
be afraid, David. It&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>She set the door into her room ajar and then
sat down by the window, and looked out at the
night. The blind was up. The night was dark
and clear. There were stars, many little glittering
points. It was very still. Elizabeth fixed her
eyes upon the sky, but after a minute or two she
did not see it at all. Her mind was full of David
and his need. This tortured, sleepless state of his
had no reality. How could it compass and oppress
the immortal image of God? Her thought rose
into peace. Elizabeth opened her mind to the
Divine light. Her will rested. She was conscious
only of that radiant peace. It enwrapped her,
it enwrapped David. In it they lived and moved
and had their being. In it they were real and
vital creatures. To lapse from consciousness of it,
was to fall upon a formless, baseless dream, wherein
were the shadows of evil. These shadows had
no reality. Brought to the light, they faded,
leaving only that peace&mdash;that radiance. Elizabeth&rsquo;s
eyes were opened. She saw the Wings of
Peace.</p>
<p>And David slept.</p>

</div>
<p>Elizabeth sat quite motionless for half an
hour. Then she stirred, bent her head for a
moment, whilst she listened to David&rsquo;s regular
breathing, and then rose to her feet. She passed
through the open door into her own room, and
undressed in the dark. Then she lay down and
slept.</p>
<p>Three times during the night she woke and
listened. But David still slept. When she woke
up for the third time, the room was full of the
greyness of the dawn. She got up and closed the
door between the two rooms.</p>
<p>Then she lay waking. It had been a strange
wedding night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>The day dawned cloudy, but broke at noon into
a cloudless warmth that was more like June than
April.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take me down the river,&rdquo; said Elizabeth,
and they rowed down for half a mile, and turned
the boat into a water-lane where budding willows
swept down on either side, and brushed the stream.</p>
<p>David was very well content to lie in the sun.
The strain was gone from him, leaving behind it a
weariness beyond words. Every limb, every muscle,
every nerve was relaxed. There was a great
peace upon him. The air tasted sweet. The
light was a pleasant thing. The sky was blue, and
so was Elizabeth&rsquo;s dress, and Elizabeth was a very
reposeful person. She did not fidget and she did
not chatter. When she spoke it was of pleasant
things.</p>
<p>David recalled a day, ten years ago, when he
had sat with her in this very place. He could see
himself, full of enthusiasm, full of youth. He
could remember how he had talked, and how
Elizabeth had listened. She was just the same
now. It was he who had changed. Ten years
ago seemed to him a very pleasant time, a very
pleasant memory. Pictures rose before him&mdash;stray
words&mdash;stray recollections running into a
long, soft blur.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>They came home in the dusk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to see Ronnie again?&rdquo; said
Elizabeth, as they landed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; he couldn&rsquo;t be doing better, but I&rsquo;ll
look in, and to-morrow Skeffington will go with
me so as to get him broken in to the change.
We ought to get away all right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David waked next day to find the sun shining in
at his uncurtained window. From where he lay
he could see the young blue of the sky, and all
the room seemed full of the sun&rsquo;s gold. David
lay in a lazy contentment watching the motes that
danced in a long shining beam. There was a new
stir of life in his veins. He stretched out his
limbs and was glad of their strength. The sweetness
and the glory and the promise of the spring
slid into his blood and fired it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; he said, still between sleeping and
waking&mdash;and with the name, memory woke.
Suddenly his brain was very clear. He looked
straight ahead and saw the door that led into the
other room&mdash;the room that had been his mother&rsquo;s.
Elizabeth was in that room. He had married
Elizabeth&mdash;she was his wife. He lay quite still
and stared at the door. Elizabeth Chantrey was
Elizabeth Blake. She was his wife&mdash;and Mary&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>A sudden spasm of laughter caught David by
the throat. Mary was what she had promised
to be&mdash;his sister; Mary was his sister. The
spasm of laughter passed, and with it the stir in
David&rsquo;s blood. He was quite cool now. He
lay staring at that closed door, and faced the
situation.</p>
<p>It was a damnable situation, he decided. He
felt as a man might feel who wakes from the
delirium of weeks, to find that in his madness he
has done some intolerable, some irrevocable thing.
A man who does not sleep is a man who is not
wholly sane. David looked back and followed
the events of the last few months with a critical
detachment.</p>
<p>He saw the strain growing and growing until,
in the end, on the brink of the abyss, he had
snatched at the relief which Elizabeth offered, as
a man who dies of thirst will snatch at water. Well&mdash;he
had taken Elizabeth&rsquo;s draught of water, his
thirst was quenched, he was his own man again.
No, never his own man any more. Never free
any more&mdash;Elizabeth&rsquo;s debtor&mdash;Elizabeth&rsquo;s husband.</p>
<p>David set his face like a flint&mdash;he would pay
his debt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>He went out as soon as he had breakfasted and
walked for a couple of hours. It was a little
after noon when he came into the drawing-room
where Elizabeth was.</p>
<p>The floor was covered with a great many yards
of green stuff which she was cutting into curtain
lengths. As David came in, she looked up and
smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>please</i>,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if you wouldn&rsquo;t mind,
I shall cut them so much better if you hold one
end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David knelt down and held the stuff, whilst
Elizabeth cut it. She came quite close to him at
the end, smiled again, and took away the two
pieces which he still clutched helplessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s beautiful,&rdquo; she said, and sat down and
began to sew.</p>
<p>David watched her in silence. If she found his
gaze embarrassing, she showed no sign.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can start to-morrow,&rdquo; he said at last.
He gave a list of trains, stopping-places, and
hotels, paused at the end of it, walked to the
window, and then, turning, said with an effort:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This has been a bad beginning for you, my
dear&mdash;you&rsquo;ve been very good to me. You deserve
a better bargain, but I&rsquo;ll do my best.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>Elizabeth did not speak at once. David
thought that she was not going to speak at all,
but after what seemed like a long time she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;David!&rdquo; and then stopped.</p>
<p>There was a good deal of colour in her cheeks.
David saw that she, too, was making an effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, and his voice was more natural.</p>
<p>&ldquo;David,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, &ldquo;what did you mean
by &lsquo;doing your best&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>David met her eyes. He had always liked
Elizabeth&rsquo;s eyes. They were so very clear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I meant that I&rsquo;d do my best to make you a
good husband,&rdquo; he said quite simply.</p>
<p>Elizabeth&rsquo;s colour rose higher still. She continued
to look at David, because she would have
considered it cowardly to look away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good husband to my good wife,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;But, David, I don&rsquo;t think you want a wife just
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David came across the room and sat down by
the table at which Elizabeth was working.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why did you marry me, Elizabeth?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>Elizabeth did not turn her head at once.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think what we both want just now,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;is friendship.&rdquo; Her voice was low, but she
kept it steady. &ldquo;The sort of friendship that is
one side of marriage. It is not really possible for
a man and a woman to be friends in that sort of
way unless they are married. I think you want
a friend&mdash;I know I do. I think you have been
very lonely&mdash;one is lonely, and it is worse for a
man. He can&rsquo;t get the home-feeling, and he
misses it. You did not marry me because you
needed a wife. I don&rsquo;t think you do. When you
want a wife, I will be your wife, but just now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She broke off. She did not look at David, but
David looked at her. He saw how tightly her
hands were clasped, he saw the colour flushing in
her cheeks. She had great self-control, but that
she was deeply moved was very evident.</p>
<p>All at once he became conscious of great fatigue.
He had walked far and in considerable distress of
mind. He had put a very strong constraint upon
himself. He rested his head on his hand and
tried to think. Elizabeth did not speak again.
After a time he raised his head. Elizabeth was
watching him&mdash;her eyes were very soft. A sense
of relief came upon David. Just to drift&mdash;just to
let things go on in the old way, on the old lines.
Not for always&mdash;just for a time&mdash;until he had
put Mary out of his thoughts. Their marriage
was not an ordinary one. It was for Elizabeth
to make what terms she would. And it was a
relief&mdash;yes, no doubt it was a relief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>&ldquo;If I say, Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is only for a time.
It is not a very possible situation, you know,
Elizabeth&mdash;not possible at all in most cases.
But just now, just for the present, I admit your
right to choose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth&rsquo;s hands relaxed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, David,&rdquo; she said.</p>

</div>
<p>David found himself enjoying his holiday a
good deal. Blue skies and shining air,
clear cold of the snows and radiant warmth of the
spring sun, sweet sleep by night and pleasant
companionship by day&mdash;all these were his portion.
His own content surprised him. He had been so
long in the dark places that he could scarcely
believe that the shadow was gone, and the day
clear again. He had been prepared to struggle
manfully against the feeling for Mary which had
haunted and tormented him for so long. To his
surprise, he found that this feeling fell into line
with the other symptoms of his illness. He shrank
from thinking of it, as he shrank from thinking of
his craving for drink, his sleepless nights, and his
dread of madness. It was all a part of the same
bad dream&mdash;a shadow among shadows, in a world
of gloom from which he had escaped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>Elizabeth was a very good companion. It was
too early to climb, but they took long walks,
shared picnic meals, and talked or were silent just
as the spirit moved them. It was the old boy and
girl companionship come back, and it was a very
restful thing. One day, when they had been
married about a fortnight, David said suddenly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you do it, Elizabeth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were sitting on a grassy slope, looking
over a wide valley where blue mists lay. A little
wind was blowing, and the upper air was clear.
The grass on which they sat was short. It was
full of innumerable small white and purple
anemones. Elizabeth was sitting on the grass,
watching the flowers, and touching first one and
then another with the tips of her fingers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>&ldquo;All these little white ones have a violet stain
at the back of each petal,&rdquo; was the last thing
that she had said, but when David spoke she
looked up, a little startled.</p>
<p>He was lying full length on a narrow ledge just
above her, with his cap over his eyes to shield
them from the sun, which was very bright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you do it, Elizabeth?&rdquo; said David
Blake.</p>
<p>Elizabeth hesitated. She could not see his
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you do it? Was it hypnotism?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no&mdash;&rdquo; There was real horror in her
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was silent for a moment. Then she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember how interested we used to
be in hypnotism, David?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s partly what made me think of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We read everything we could lay hands on&mdash;all
the books on psychic phenomena&mdash;Charcot&rsquo;s
experiments&mdash;everything. And do you remember
the conclusion we came to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ve forgotten. I can remember
you stamping up and down my little room
and saying, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a <i>damnable</i> thing, Elizabeth, a
perfectly damnable thing. There&rsquo;s <i>no</i> end, absolutely
none to the extent to which it undermines
everything&mdash;I believe it is a much more real devil
than any that the theologies produce.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s
what you said nine years ago, David, and I
agreed with you. We used quite a lot of strong
language between us, and I don&rsquo;t feel called upon
to retract any of it. Hypnotism <i>is</i> a damnable
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David pushed the cap back from his eyes as
Elizabeth spoke, and raised himself on his elbow,
so that he could see her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are degrees,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s very
hard to define. How would you define it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not easy. &lsquo;The unlawful influence of
one mind over another&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s begging the question. At what point
does it become unlawful?&mdash;that&rsquo;s the crux.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose at the point when force of will
overbears sense&mdash;reason&mdash;conscience. You may
persuade a man to lend you money, but you
mayn&rsquo;t pick his pocket or hypnotise him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How practical!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then very suddenly:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>&ldquo;So it wasn&rsquo;t hypnotism. Are you <i>sure</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, quite sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But can you be sure? There&rsquo;s such a thing
as the unconscious exercise of will power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing in the least unconscious in
what I do. I know very well what I am about,
and I know enough about hypnotism to know
that it is not that. I don&rsquo;t use my will at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you do? How is it done?&rdquo; His
tone was interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Elizabeth slowly, &ldquo;that it is
done by <i>realising</i>, by getting into touch with
Reality. Things like sleeplessness, pain, and
strain aren&rsquo;t right&mdash;they aren&rsquo;t normal. They
are like bad dreams. If one wakes&mdash;if one sees
the reality&mdash;the dream is gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke as if she were struggling to find words
for some idea which filled her mind, but was hard
to put into a communicable shape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is life on the Fourth Dimension,&rdquo; she said
at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said David, &ldquo;go on.&rdquo; There was a
slightly quizzical look in his eyes, but he was
interested. &ldquo;What do you mean by the Fourth
Dimension?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>&ldquo;We used to talk of that too, and lately I have
thought about it a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is so hard to put into words. Fourth
Dimensional things won&rsquo;t get into Third Dimensional
words. One has to try and try, and then
a little scrap of the meaning comes through.
That is why there are so many creeds, so many
sects. They are all an attempt to express&mdash;and
one can&rsquo;t really express the thing. I can&rsquo;t say it,
I can only feel it. It is limitless, and words are
limited. There are no bounds or barriers. Take
Thought, for instance&mdash;that is Fourth Dimensional&mdash;and
Love. Religion is a purely Fourth
Dimensional thing, and we all guess and translate
as best we may. In all religions that have life,
apprehension rises above the creed and reaches
out to the Real&mdash;the untranslatable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s true; but go on&mdash;define the Fourth
Dimension.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can see it, you know. It&rsquo;s another plane.
It is the plane which permeates and inter-penetrates
all other planes&mdash;universal, eternal, unchanging.
It&rsquo;s like the Fire of God&mdash;searching
all things. It is the plane of Reality. Nothing is
real which is not universal and unchanging and
eternal. If one can realise that plane, one is
amongst the realities, and all that is unreal goes
out. &lsquo;There is no life but the Life of God, no
consciousness but the Divine Consciousness.&rsquo; I
think that is the best definition of all: &lsquo;the Divine
Consciousness.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not know that she was quoting, and he
did not answer her or speak at all for some time.
But at last he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I slept, because you saw me in the Divine
Consciousness; is that it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t will that I should sleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you doing it still?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Elizabeth again.</p>
<p>David sat up. The mists in the valley
beneath were golden, for the sun had dropped.
As he looked, the gold turned grey, and the
shadow of darkness to come rose out of the
valley&rsquo;s depths, though the hill-slope on which
they sat was warm and sunny yet. David
turned and saw that Elizabeth was watching
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to stop whatever it is you do,&rdquo; he
said abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not as ungrateful as that sounds&mdash;&rdquo;
He broke off, and Elizabeth said quickly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I? You are well again. You
don&rsquo;t need my help any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shadow like the shadow of evening came
over her as she spoke, but her smile betrayed
nothing.</p>
<p>They walked back to the hotel in silence.</p>
<p>David had wondered if he would sleep. He
slept all night, the sweet sound sleep of health and
a mind unburdened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>It was Elizabeth who did not sleep. She had
walked with him through the valley of the shadow
and he had come out of it a whole man again.
Was she to cling to the shadow, because in the
shadow David had clung to her? It came to that.
She drove the thought home, and did not shirk the
pain of it. They were come out into the light,
and in the light he had no need of her. But this
was not full daylight in which they walked&mdash;it
was only the first chill grey of the dawn, and
there is always a need of Love. Love needs
must give, and giving, blesses and is blessed, for
Love is of the realities&mdash;a thing immutable and
all-pervading. No man can shut out Love.</p>

</div>
<p>David came home after his month&rsquo;s holiday
as hard and healthy as a man may be.
Elizabeth was well content. She and David were
friends. He liked her company, he ate and slept,
he was well, and he laughed sometimes as the old
David had laughed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think your master looks well, Mrs.
Havergill?&rdquo; she said quite gaily.</p>
<p>Mrs. Havergill sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He do look well,&rdquo; she admitted; &ldquo;but there,
ma&rsquo;am, there&rsquo;s no saying&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t looks as we
can go by. In my own family now, there was
my sister Sarah. She was a fine, fresh-looking
woman. Old Dr. Jones he met her out walking,
as it might be on the Thursday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, Miss Sarah, you <i>do</i> look well,&rsquo; he says&mdash;and
there, &rsquo;tweren&rsquo;t but the following Tuesday
as she was took. &lsquo;Who&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; thought it,&rsquo; he says.
&lsquo;In the midst of life we are in death,&rsquo; and that&rsquo;s
a true word. And my brother &rsquo;Enry now, &rsquo;e
never look so well in all &rsquo;is life as when he was
laying in &rsquo;is coffin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth could afford to laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Havergill, do be cheerful,&rdquo; she
implored; &ldquo;it would be so much better for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Havergill looked injured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see as we&rsquo;re sent into this world to
be cheerful,&rdquo; she said, with the air of one who
reproves unchristian levity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but we are&mdash;we really are,&rdquo; said Elizabeth.</p>
<p>Mrs. Havergill shook her head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let them be cheerful as has no troubles,&rdquo; she
remarked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;ad mine, and a-plenty,&rdquo; and
she went out of the room, sighing.</p>
<p>Mary ran in to see her sister quite early on the
morning after their return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Liz&mdash;no, let me <i>look</i> at you&mdash;I&rsquo;ll kiss
you in a minute. Are you <i>happy</i>&mdash;you wrote
dreadful guide-book letters, that I tore up and
put in the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Molly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they were&mdash;exactly like Baedeker, only
worse. All about mountains and flowers and the
nice air, and &lsquo;David is quite well again.&rsquo; As
if <i>anyone</i> wanted to hear about mountains and
flowers from a person on her honeymoon. Are
you <i>happy</i>, Liz?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I look happy?&rdquo; said Elizabeth laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you do.&rdquo; Mary looked at her considering.
&ldquo;You <i>do</i>. Is it all right, Liz, <i>really</i> all
right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s really all right, Molly,&rdquo; said Elizabeth,
and then she began to talk of other things.</p>
<p>Mary kissed her very affectionately when she
went away, but at the door she turned, frowning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect you wrote <i>reams</i> to Agneta,&rdquo; she
said, and then shut the door quickly before Elizabeth
had time to answer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>David was out when Mary came, and it so
happened that for two or three days they did not
meet. He had come to dread the meeting. His
passion for Mary was dead. He was afraid lest
her presence, her voice, should raise the dead and
bring it forth again in its garment of glamour and
pain. Then on Sunday he came in to find Mary
sitting there with Elizabeth in the twilight. She
jumped up as he came in, and held out her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, David, you are a nice brother&mdash;never to
have come and seen me. Busy? Yes, of course
you&rsquo;ve been busy, but you might have squeezed
in a visit to me, amongst all the visits to sick old
ladies and naughty little boys. Oh, <i>do</i> you know,
Katie Ellerton has gone away? She took Ronnie
to Brighton for a change, and then wrote and
said she wasn&rsquo;t coming back. I believe she is
going to live with a brother who is a solicitor down
there. And she&rsquo;s selling her furniture, so if you
<i>want</i> extra things you might get them cheap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Elizabeth&rsquo;s department,&rdquo; said David,
laughing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this is for you both. When will you
come to dinner? On Tuesday? Yes, do. Talk
about being busy. Edward&rsquo;s busy, if you like.
I never see him, and he&rsquo;s quite worried. Liz, you
remember Jack Webster? Well, you know he&rsquo;s on
the West Coast, and he&rsquo;s sent Edward a whole
case of things&mdash;frightfully exciting specimens,
two centipedes he&rsquo;s wanted for ever so long, and
a spider that Jack says is new. And Edward
has never even had time to open the case. That
shows you! It&rsquo;s accounts, I believe. Edward
does hate accounts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she had gone David sat silent for a long
time. It was the old Mary, and prettier than
ever. He had never seen her looking prettier,
but his feeling for her was gone. He could look
at her quite dispassionately, and wonder over the
old unreasoning thrill. And what a chatterbox
she was. Thank Heaven, she had had the sense
to marry Edward, who was really not such a bad
sort. Poor Edward. He laughed aloud suddenly,
and Elizabeth looked up and asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Edward and the case he can&rsquo;t open, and the
centipedes he can&rsquo;t play with,&rdquo; he said, still
laughing. &ldquo;Poor old Edward! What it is to
have a conscience. I wonder he doesn&rsquo;t have a
midnight orgy with the centipedes, but I suppose
Mary sees to that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>It was that night that David dreamed his dream
again. All these months it had never come to
him. Amongst the many dreams that had haunted
his sick brain, there had been no hint of this
one. He had wondered about it sometimes. And
now it returned. In the first deep sleep that
comes to a healthy man he dreamed it.</p>
<p>He heard the wind blowing&mdash;that was the
beginning of it. It came from the far distances
of space, and it passed on again to the far distances
beyond. David heard it blow, but his eyes
were darkened. Then suddenly he saw. His
feet were on the shining sand, the sand that shone
because a golden moon looked down upon it from
a clear sky, and the tide had left it wet.</p>
<p>David stood upon the shining sand, and saw
the Woman of the Dream stand where the moon-track
ceased at the sea&rsquo;s rim. The moon was
behind her head, and the wind blew out her hair.
He stood as he had stood a hundred times, and
as he had longed a hundred times to see the
Woman&rsquo;s face, so he longed now. He moved to
go to her, and the wind blew about him in his
dream.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>Elizabeth had sat late in her room. There was
a book in her hand, but after a time she did not
read. The night was very warm. She got up
and opened the window wide. The moon was low
and nearly full, and a wind blew out of the west&mdash;such
a warm wind, full of the scent of green,
growing things. Elizabeth put out the light and
stood by the window, drawing long breaths. It
seemed as if the wind were blowing right through
her. It beat upon her uncovered throat, and
the touch of it was like something alive. It
sang in her ears, and Elizabeth&rsquo;s blood sang
too.</p>
<p>And then, quite suddenly, she heard a sound
that stopped her heart. She heard the handle
of the door between her room and David&rsquo;s turn
softly, and she heard a step upon the threshold.
All her life was at her heart, waiting. She could
neither move, nor speak, nor draw her breath.
And the wind blew out her long white dress, and
the wind blew out her hair. As in a trance between
one world and the next, she heard a voice
in the room. It was David&rsquo;s voice, and yet not
David&rsquo;s voice, and it shook the very foundations
of her being.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn round and let me see your face, Woman
of my Dream,&rdquo; said David Blake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>Elizabeth stood quite still. Only her breath
came again. The wind brought it back to her,
and as she drew it in, the step came nearer and
David said again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show me your face&mdash;your face; I have never
seen your face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned then, very slowly&mdash;in obedience to
an effort, that left her drained of strength.</p>
<p>David was standing in the middle of the room.
His feet were bare, as he had risen from his bed,
but his eyes were open, and they looked not at,
but through Elizabeth, to the place where she
walked in his dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said David on a long, slow, sudden
breath.</p>
<p>He came nearer&mdash;nearer. Now he stood beside
her, and the wind swept suddenly between them,
and eddying, drove a great swathe of her unfastened
hair across his breast. David put up his
hand and touched the hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t see your face,&rdquo; he said, in a strange,
complaining note. &ldquo;The moon shines on your
hair, but not upon your face. Show me your
face&mdash;your face&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She moved, and the moon shone on her. Her
face was as white as ivory. Her eyes wide and
dark&mdash;as dark as the darkening sky. They stood
in silence, and the moon sank low.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>Then David put out his hands and touched her
on the breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I have seen your face,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now
I am content because I have seen your face. I
have gone hungry for the sight of it, and have
gone thirsty for the love of you, and all the years
I have never seen your face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth&rsquo;s voice came in a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I am content.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your face is the face of Love,&rdquo; said David
Blake.</p>
<p>His hands still held her hair. They lay against
her heart, and moved a little as she breathed.</p>
<p>A sudden terror raised its head and peered at
Elizabeth. Mary&mdash;oh, God&mdash;if he took her for
Mary. The thought struck her as with a spear
of ice. It burned as ice burns, and froze her as ice
freezes. Her lips were stiff as she forced out the
words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who am I? Say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His hands were warm. He answered her at
once.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>&ldquo;We are in the Dream, you and I. You are
the Woman of the Dream. Your face is the face
of Love, and your hair&mdash;your floating hair&mdash;&rdquo; He
paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My hair&mdash;what colour is my hair?&rdquo; whispered
Elizabeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your hair&mdash;&rdquo; He lifted a strand of it. The
wind played through it, and it brushed his cheek,
then fell again upon her breast. His hand closed
down upon it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What colour is my hair?&rdquo; said Elizabeth very
quietly. Mary&rsquo;s hair was dark. Even in the
moonlight, Mary&rsquo;s hair would be dark. If he
said dark hair, dark like the night which would
close upon them when that low moon was gone&mdash;what
should she do&mdash;oh, God, what should
she do?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your hair is gold&mdash;moon gold, which is pale as
a dream,&rdquo; said David Blake. And a great shudder
ran through Elizabeth from head to foot as the ice
went from her heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like moon gold,&rdquo; repeated David, and his
hands were warm against her breast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>And then all at once they were in the dark
together, for the moon went out suddenly like a
blown candle. She had dropped into a bank of
clouds that rose from the clouding west. The
wind blew a little chill, and as suddenly as the
light had gone, David, too, was gone. One
moment, so near&mdash;touching her in the darkness&mdash;and
the next, gone&mdash;gone noiselessly, leaving
her shaking, quivering.</p>
<p>When she could move, she lit a candle and
looked in through the open door. David lay upon
his side, with one hand under his cheek. He was
sleeping like a child.</p>
<p>Elizabeth shut the door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>

<p class="t0">Where have I seen these tall black trees,</p>
<p class="t">Two and two and three&mdash;yes, seven,</p>
<p class="t0">Standing all about in a ring,</p>

<p class="t0">How did we come here, you and I,</p>
<p class="t">With the pool beneath, and the trees above?</p>
<p class="t0">Oh, even in death or the dusk of a dream,</p>
<p class="t">You are heart of the heart of Love.</p>
</div>
<p>Elizabeth was very pale when she came
down the next day. As she dressed, she
could hear David singing and whistling in his
room. He went down the stairs like a schoolboy,
and when she followed she found him opening his
letters and whistling still.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Good-morning. You&rsquo;re
late, and I&rsquo;ve only got half an hour to breakfast
in. I&rsquo;m starving, I don&rsquo;t believe you gave me any
dinner last night. I shall be late for lunch.
Give me something cold when I come in, I&rsquo;ve
got a pretty full day&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth wondered as she listened to him if it
were she who had dreamed.</p>
<p>That evening he looked up suddenly from his
book and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was the moon full last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth was startled. Did he, after all,
remember anything?</p>
<p>&ldquo;When is it full?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow, I think. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her breathing quickened a little as she asked
the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I dreamed my dream again last
night, and it generally comes when the moon is
full,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Elizabeth turned, as if to get more light upon
her book. She could not sit and let him see her
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your dream&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice was low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>He paused for so long that the silence seemed
to close upon Elizabeth. Then he said thoughtfully:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dreams are odd things. I&rsquo;ve had this one
off and on since I was a boy. And it&rsquo;s always the
same. But I have not had it for months. Then
last night&mdash;&rdquo; He broke off. &ldquo;Do you know
I&rsquo;ve never told any one about it before&mdash;does it
bore you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, and could not have said
more to save her life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a queer dream, and it never varies.
There&rsquo;s always the same long, wet stretch of
sand, and the moon shining over the sea. And
a woman&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She stands at the edge of the sea with the
moon behind her, and the wind&mdash;did I tell you
about the wind?&mdash;it blows her hair and her dress.
And I have never seen her face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, never. I&rsquo;ve always wanted to, but I
can never get near enough, and the moon is behind
her. When I was a boy, I used to walk in my
sleep when I had the dream. I used to wake up in
all sorts of odd places. Once I got as far as the
front-door step, and waked with my feet on the
wet stones. I suppose I was looking for the
Woman.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>Elizabeth took a grip of herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you walk in your sleep now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. Not since I was a boy,&rdquo; he said
cheerfully. &ldquo;Mrs. Havergill would have evolved
a ghost story long ago if I had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And last night your dream was just the
same?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, just the same. It always ends just when
it might get exciting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you wake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. That&rsquo;s the odd part. One is supposed
to dream only when one is waking, and of course
it&rsquo;s very hard to tell, but my impression is, that
at the point where my dream ends I drop more
deeply asleep. Dreams are queer things. I
don&rsquo;t know why I told you about this one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took up his book as he spoke, and they
talked no more.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Elizabeth went to her room early that night,
but she did not get into bed. She moved about
the room, hanging up the dress she had worn,
folding her things&mdash;even sorting out a drawer full
of odds and ends. It seemed as if she must
occupy herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>Presently she heard David come up and go into
his room. She went on rolling up stray bits of
lace and ribbon with fingers that seemed oddly
numb. When she had finished, she began to
brush her hair, standing before the glass, and
brushing with a long, rhythmic movement. After
about ten minutes she turned suddenly and blew
out the candle. She went to the window and
opened it wide.</p>
<p>Then, because she was trembling, she sat down
on the window-seat and waited. The night came
into the room and filled it. The trees moved
above the water. The rumble of traffic in the
High Street sounded very far away. It had nothing
to do with the world in which Elizabeth
waited. There was no wind to-night. It was
very still and warm. The moon shone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>When the door opened, Elizabeth knew that she
had known that he would come. He crossed the
room and took her in his arms. She felt his arms
about her, she felt his kiss, and there was nothing
of the unsubstantial stuff of dreams in his strong
clasp. For one moment, as her lips kissed too,
she thought that he was awake&mdash;that he had
remembered, but as she stepped back and looked
into his face she saw that he was in his dream.
His eyes looked far away. Then he kissed her
again, and dreaming or waking her soul went out
of her and was his soul, her very consciousness was
no more hers, but his, and she, too, saw that
strange, moon-guarded shore, and she, too, heard
the wind. But the night&mdash;the night was still.
Where did it come from, this sudden rush of the
wind, that seemed to blow through her? From
far away it came, from very far away, and it passed
through her and on to its own far place again,
a rushing eddy of wind, whirling about some
unknown centre.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was giddy and faint with the singing
of that wind in her ears. The moon was in her
eyes. She trembled, and hid them upon David&rsquo;s
breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;David,&rdquo; she whispered at last, and he
answered her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love&mdash;love&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned a little from the light and looked at
him. There was a smile upon his face, and his
eyes smiled too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we?&rdquo; she said. And David laid
his face against hers and said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>&ldquo;We are in the Dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;David, what is the Dream? Do you know?
Tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the Dream,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the old dream, the
dream that has no waking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who am I? Am I Elizabeth?&rdquo; She
feared so much to say it, and could not rest till
it was said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elizabeth.&rdquo; He repeated the word, and
paused. His eyes clouded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are the Woman of the Dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I have a name&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;you have a name, but I have forgotten&mdash;if
I could remember it. It is the name&mdash;the old
name&mdash;the name you had before the moon went
down. It was at night. You kissed me. There
were so many trees. I knew your name. Then
the moon went down, and it was dark, and I forgot&mdash;not
you&mdash;only the name. Are you angry,
love, because I have forgotten your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was trouble in his tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not angry,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, with a quiver
in her voice. &ldquo;Will you call me Elizabeth, David?
Will you say Elizabeth to me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>He said &ldquo;Elizabeth,&rdquo; and as he said it his face
changed. For a moment she thought that he
was waking. His arms dropped from about her,
and he drew a long, deep breath that was like a
sigh.</p>
<p>Then he went slowly from her into the darkness
of his own room, walking as if he saw.</p>
<p>Elizabeth fell on her knees by the window-seat
and hid her face. The wind still sang in her ears.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">THE FULL MOON</span></h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The sun was cold, the dark dead Moon</p>
<p class="t">Hung low behind dull leaden bars,</p>
<p class="t0">And you came barefoot down the sky</p>
<p class="t">Between the grey unlighted Stars.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">You laid your hand upon my soul,</p>
<p class="t">My soul that cried to you for rest,</p>
<p class="t0">And all the light of the lost Sun</p>
<p class="t">Was in the comfort of your breast.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">There was no veil upon your heart,</p>
<p class="t">There was no veil upon your eyes;</p>

<p class="t">Nor long for that dead Moon to rise.</p>
</div>
<p>They dined with Edward and Mary next day.</p>
<p>The centipedes were still immured, and
Edward made tentative overtures to David on
the subject of broaching the case after dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Edward is the soul of hospitality,&rdquo; David said
afterwards. &ldquo;He keeps his best to the end.
First, a positively good dinner, then some comparatively
enjoyable music, and, last of all, the
superlatively enthralling centipedes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>At the time, he complied with a very good
grace. He even contrived a respectable degree
of enthusiasm when the subject came up.</p>
<p>It was Mary who insisted on the comparatively
agreeable music.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;I will not have you two going off by
yourselves the moment you&rsquo;ve swallowed your
dinner. It&rsquo;s not <i>good</i> for people. Edward will
certainly have indigestion&mdash;yes, Edward, you
know you will. Come and have coffee with us in
a proper and decent fashion, and we&rsquo;ll have some
music, and then you shall do anything you like,
and I&rsquo;ll talk to Elizabeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edward sang only one song, and then said that
he was hoarse, which was not true. But Elizabeth
was glad when the door closed upon him and
David, for the song Edward had sung was the one
thing on earth which she felt least able to hear.
He sang, <i>O Moon of my Delight</i>, transposed by
Mary to suit his voice, and he sang it with his
usual tuneful correctness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>Elizabeth looked up only once, and that was
just at the end. David was looking at her with a
frown of perplexity. But as Edward remarked
that he was hoarse, David passed his hand across
his eyes for a moment, as if to brush something
away, and rose with alacrity to leave the
room.</p>
<p>When they were gone Mary drew a chair close
to her sister and sat down. She was rather silent
for a time, and Elizabeth was beginning to find it
hard to keep her own thoughts at bay, when Mary
said in a new, gentle voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Liz, I&rsquo;m so <i>happy</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you, Molly?&rdquo; She spoke rather absently,
and Mary became softly offended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to know why, Liz? I don&rsquo;t
believe you care a bit. I don&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;d
mind if I were ever so miserable, now that you&rsquo;ve
got David, and are happy yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth came back to her surroundings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Molly, what a goose you are, and what a
monster you make me out. What is it, Mollykins,
tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a great mind not to. I don&rsquo;t believe
you really care. I wouldn&rsquo;t tell you a word, only
I can&rsquo;t help it. Oh, Liz, I&rsquo;m going to have a
baby, and I thought I never should. I was making
myself <i>wretched</i> about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She caught Elizabeth&rsquo;s hand and squeezed it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Liz, be glad for me. I&rsquo;m so glad and
happy, and I want some one to be glad too.
You don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;ve wanted it. No one
knows. I&rsquo;ve simply hated all the people in the
<i>Morning Post</i> who had babies. I&rsquo;ve not even
read the first column for weeks, and when Sybil
Delamere sent me an invitation to her baby&rsquo;s
christening&mdash;she was married the same day I was,
you know&mdash;I just tore it up and <i>burnt</i> it. And
now it&rsquo;s really coming to me, and you&rsquo;re to be
glad for me, Liz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Molly, darling, I <i>am</i> glad&mdash;so glad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary looked up into her sister&rsquo;s face, searchingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re thinking of me, <i>really</i> of me&mdash;not
about David, as you were just now? Oh, yes, I
knew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, Molly, mayn&rsquo;t I think of my own
husband?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not when I&rsquo;m telling you about a thing like
this,&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;Liz, you are the first person
I have told, the <i>very</i> first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth did not allow her thoughts to wander
again. As they talked, the rain beat heavily
against the windows, and they heard the rush of
it in the gutters below.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>&ldquo;What a pity,&rdquo; Mary cried. &ldquo;How quickly it
has come up, and last night was so lovely. Did
you see the moon? And to-night it is full.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, to-night it is full,&rdquo; said Elizabeth.</p>
<p>Edward and Mary came down to see their
guests off. Edward shut the door behind them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a night!&rdquo; he exclaimed. But Mary
came close and whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edward&rsquo;s tone was just the least shade perfunctory.
He slid home the bolt of the door and
turning, caught Mary in his arms and hugged her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Mary, <i>darling</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary glowed, responsive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Mary, darling, it really <i>is</i> a new spider,&rdquo;
he cried.</p>
<p>David and Elizabeth walked home in a steady
downpour. Mary had lent her overshoes, and she
had tucked up her dress under a mackintosh of
Edward&rsquo;s. There was much merriment over
their departure with a large umbrella between
them, but as they walked home, they both grew
silent. Elizabeth said good-night in the hall,
and ran up to her room. To-night he would not
come. Oh, to-night she felt quite sure that he
would not come. It was dark. She heard the
rain falling into the river, and she could just see
how the trees bent in the rush of it. And yet she
sat for an hour, by her window, in the dark, waiting
breathlessly for that which would not happen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>The time went slowly by. The rain fell, and it
was cold. Elizabeth lay down in the great square
bed, and presently she slept, lulled by the steady
dropping of the rain. She slept, and in her sleep
she dreamed that she was sinking fathoms deep
in a stormy, angry sea. Far overhead, she could
hear the clash of the waves, and the long, long
sullen roar of the swelling storm. And she went
down and down into a black darkness that was
deeper than any night&mdash;down, till she lost the
roar of the storm above, down until all sound was
gone, and she was alone in a black silence that
would never lift or break again. Her soul was
cold and blind, and most unendurably alone.
Then something touched her, something that was
warm. There came upon her that strange sense
of home-coming, which comes to us in dreams, when
love comes back to us across the sundering years,
and all the pains of life, the pains of death, vanish
and are gone, and we are come home&mdash;home to
the place where we would be.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>In her dream Elizabeth was come home. It was
so long, so long, that she had wandered&mdash;so many
years, so many lands&mdash;such weary feet and such a
weary way. Now she was come home.</p>
<p>She stirred and opened her eyes. The rain had
ceased. The room was dark, but the moon shone,
for a single shaft struck between the curtains and
lay above the bed like a silver feather dropped
from some great passing wing.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was awake. She saw these things.
She was come home. David&rsquo;s arms were about
her in the darkness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE WOMAN OF THE DREAM</span></h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Oh, was it in the dead of night,</p>
<p class="t">Or in the dark before the day,</p>
<p class="t0">You came to me and kneeling, knew</p>
<p class="t">The thing that I would never say?</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">There was no star, nor any moon,</p>
<p class="t">There was no light from pole to pole,</p>
<p class="t0">And yet you saw the secret thing,</p>
<p class="t">That I had hid within my soul.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">You saw the secret and the shrine,</p>
<p class="t">You bowed your head and went your way&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Oh, was it in the dead of night,</p>
<p class="t">Or in the dark that brings the day?</p>
</div>
<p>For the next fortnight Elizabeth lived in a
dream from which she scarcely woke by day.
The dream life&mdash;the dream love&mdash;the dream itself&mdash;these
became her life. In the moments that
came nearest the waking she trembled, because if
the dream was her life, the waking would be death.
But for the rest of the time she walked in a trance.
Earth budded, and the birds built nests. The
green of woodland places went down under a
flood of bluebells. The children made cowslip
balls. All day long the sun shone out of a blue
sky, and at night David came to her. Always he
came at night, and went away in the dawn. And
he remembered nothing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>Once she put her face to his in the darkness,
and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, David, won&rsquo;t you remember&mdash;won&rsquo;t you
ever remember? Am I only the Woman of the
Dream? When will you remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then David was troubled in his dream, and
stirred and went from her an hour before the
time of his going.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the fortnight her trance
wore thin. It was then that everything she saw or
read seemed to press in upon one sore spot. If she
went to the Mottisfonts&rsquo;, there was Mary with
her talk of Edward and the baby. Edward!&mdash;Elizabeth
could have laughed; but the laughter
went too. If there were not much of Edward, at
least Mary had all that there was. And the child&mdash;did
not she, too, desire children? But the child
of a dream. How could she give to David the
child of a dream already forgotten? If she walked,
there were lovers in every lane, young lovers, who
loved each other by day and in the eye of the
sun. If she took up a book&mdash;once what she read
was:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Come to me in my dreams, and then</p>
<p class="t0">By day I shall be well again!</p>
<p class="t0">For then the night will more than pay</p>
<p class="t0">The hopeless longing of the day.</p>
</div>
<p>and another time, Kingsley&rsquo;s <i>Dolcino to Margaret</i>.
Then came a day when she opened her Bible and
read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If a man walk in the night, he stumbleth,
because there is no light in him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That day she came broad awake. The daze
passed from her. Her brain was clear, and her
conscience&mdash;the inner vision rose before her,
showing her an image troubled and confused.
What had she done? And what was she doing
now? Day by day David looked at her with the
eyes of a friend, and night by night he came to
her, the lover of a dream. Which was the reality?
Which was the real David? If the David of the
dream were real, conscious in sleep of some mysterious
oneness, the sense of which was lost in the
glare of day&mdash;then she could wait, and bear, and
hope, till the realisation was so strong that the
sun might shine upon it and show to David awake
what the sleeping David knew.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>But if the David of the dream were not the
real David, then what was she? Mistress and
no wife&mdash;the mistress of a dream mood that
never touched Reality at all.</p>
<p>Two scalding tears in Elizabeth&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;two
and no more. The others burned her heart.</p>
<p>And the thought stayed with her.</p>
<p>That evening after dinner Elizabeth looked up
from her embroidery. The silence had grown to
be too full of thoughts. She could not bear it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you reading, David?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>He laughed and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sentimental poetry, ma&rsquo;am. Would you have
suspected me of it? I find it very soothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused, and then said with a flutter in her
throat:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you ever write poetry now, David? You
used to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember boring you with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He coloured a little as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But since then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show me some&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>&ldquo;Poetry is such an awful give away. How any
one ever dares to publish any, I don&rsquo;t know. I
suppose they get hardened. But one&rsquo;s most
private letters aren&rsquo;t a patch on it. One puts
down all one&rsquo;s grumbles, one&rsquo;s moonstruck fancies,
the ravings of one&rsquo;s inanest moments. Mine are
not for circulation, thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth did not laugh. Instead she said,
quite seriously,</p>
<p>&ldquo;David, I wish you would show me some of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked rather surprised, but got up, and
presently came back with some papers in his hand,
and threw them into her lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There. There&rsquo;s one there that&rsquo;s rather odd.
It&rsquo;s rotten poetry, but it gave me the oddest
feelings when I wrote it. See if it does the same
to you,&rdquo; and he laughed.</p>
<p>There were three poems in Elizabeth&rsquo;s lap.
The first was a vigorous bit of work&mdash;a ballad
with a good ballad swing to it. Elizabeth read it
and applauded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is much better than your old things,&rdquo;
she said, and he was manifestly pleased.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>The next was a set of clever verses on a political
topic of passing interest. Elizabeth laughed over
it and laid it aside. Her thoughts were pleasantly
diverted. Anything was welcome that brought
her nearer to the David of the day.</p>
<p>She took up the third poem. It was called:</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Egypt</span></h3>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Egypt sands are burning hot.</p>
<p class="t">Burning hot and dry,</p>
<p class="t0">How they scorched us as we worked,</p>
<p class="t">Toiling, you and I,</p>
<p class="t0">When we built the Pyramid in Egypt.</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">We were very wise, my dear,</p>

<div class="verse">

<p class="t0">I&rsquo;d go back three thousand years</p>
<p class="t">If I only might,&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Back to toil and pain and you and Egypt.</p>
</div>
<p>When she looked up at the end, David spoke
at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what does it say to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It set up one of those curious thought-waves.
One seems to remember something out of an
extraordinarily distant past. Have you ever felt
it? I believe most people have. There are all
sorts of theories to account for it. The two sides
of the brain working unequally, and several others.
But the impression is common enough, and the
theories have been made to fit it. Of course the
one that fits most happily is the hopelessly unscientific
one of reincarnation. Well, my thought-wave
took me back to Egypt and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>He hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth&rsquo;s voice was eager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed at her earnestness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then&mdash;I saw the woman&rsquo;s eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were grey. That&rsquo;s all. And I thought
it odd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off, and Elizabeth asked no more.
She knew very well why he had thought it odd
that the woman&rsquo;s eyes should be grey. The poems
were dated, and <i>Egypt</i> bore the date of a year
ago. He was in love with Mary then, and Mary&rsquo;s
eyes were dark&mdash;dark hazel eyes.</p>
<p>That night she woke from a dream of Mary,
and heard David whispering a name in his sleep,
but she could not catch the name. The old
shamed dread and horror came upon her, strong
and unbroken. She slipped from bed, and stood
by the window, panting for breath. And out of
the darkness David called to her:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>&ldquo;Love, where are you gone to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If he would say her name&mdash;if he would only say
her name. She had no words to answer him, but
she heard him rise and come to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you go away?&rdquo; he said, touching
her. And as she had done once before, Elizabeth
cried out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who am I, David?&mdash;tell me! Am I Mary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He repeated the name slowly, and each repetition
was a wound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; he said, wonderingly, &ldquo;there is no
Mary in the Dream. There are only you and I&mdash;and
you are Love&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if I went out of the Dream?&rdquo; said Elizabeth,
leaning against his breast. The comfort of
his touch stole back into her heart. Her breathing steadied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I would come and find you,&rdquo; said David
Blake.</p>
<p>It was the next day that Agneta&rsquo;s letter came.
Elizabeth opened it at breakfast and exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She lifted a face of distress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;David, should you mind if I were to go away
for a little? Agneta wants me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agneta?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Agneta Mainwaring. You remember, I
used to go and stay with the Mainwarings in
Devonshire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember. What&rsquo;s the matter with
her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is engaged to Douglas Strange, the explorer,
and there are&mdash;rumours that his whole
party has been massacred. He was working across
Africa. She wants me to come to her. I think I
must. You don&rsquo;t mind, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not. When do you want to go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to go to-day. I could send her
a wire,&rdquo; said Elizabeth. &ldquo;I hope it&rsquo;s only a
rumour, and not true, but I must go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take it too much to heart, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>He said good-bye to her before he went out,
told her to take care of herself, asked her to write,
and inquired if she wanted any money.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>When he had gone, Elizabeth told herself that
this was the end of the Dream. She could drift no
more with the tide of that moon-watched sea.
She must think things out and come to some
decision. Hitherto, if she thought by day, the
night with its glamour threw over her thoughts a
rainbow mist that hid and confused them. Now
Agneta needed her, there would be work for her to
do. And she would not see David again until
she could look her conscience in the face.</p>

<p>Elizabeth went up to London by the 12.22,
which is a fast train, and only stops once.</p>
<p>She found Agneta, worn, tired, and cross.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank Heaven, you&rsquo;ve come, Lizabeth,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;All my relations have been to see me.
They are so kind. They are so <i>dreadfully</i> kind,
and they all talk about its being God&rsquo;s Will, and
tell me what a beautiful thing resignation is. If I
believed in a God who arranged for people to
murder each other in order to give some one else
a moral lesson, I&rsquo;d shoot myself. I really would.
And resignation is a perfectly horrible thing. I
do think I must be getting a little better than I
used to be, because I wasn&rsquo;t even rude to Aunt
Henrietta, who told me I ought not to repine,
because all was for the best. She said there
were many trials in the married state, and that
those who did not marry were spared the sorrow of
losing a child or having an unfaithful husband. I
really wasn&rsquo;t rude to her, Lizabeth&mdash;I swear I
wasn&rsquo;t. But when I saw my cousin, Mabel
Aston, coming up the street&mdash;you always can see
her a mile off&mdash;I told Jane to say that I was very
sorry, but I really couldn&rsquo;t see any one. Mabel
won&rsquo;t ever forgive me, because all the other
relations will tell her that I saw them. I told them
every one that I was perfectly certain that Douglas
was all right. And so I am. Yes, really. But,
oh, Lizabeth, how I do hate the newspapers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t read them,&rdquo; said Elizabeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t! Nothing would induce me to. But
I can&rsquo;t stop my relations from quoting reams of
them, verbatim. By the by, do you mind dining
at seven to-night? I want to go to church. I
don&rsquo;t want you or Louis to come. Heavens,
Lizabeth, you&rsquo;ve no idea what a relief it is not to
have to be polite, and say you want people when
you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>When Agneta had gone out Elizabeth talked to
Louis for a little, and then read. Presently she
stopped reading and leaned back with closed eyes,
thinking first of Agneta, then of herself and David.
Louis&rsquo;s voice broke in upon her thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lizabeth, what <i>is</i> it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was startled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I was just thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the good?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I told you I
could see. You&rsquo;re troubled, horribly troubled
about something. And it&rsquo;s not Agneta. What
is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth was rather pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Louis,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;please don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;d
rather you didn&rsquo;t. And it&rsquo;s not what you think.
It&rsquo;s not really a trouble. I&rsquo;m puzzled. I don&rsquo;t
know what to do. There&rsquo;s something I have to
think out. And it&rsquo;s not clear&mdash;I can&rsquo;t quite
see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louis regarded her seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If any man lack wisdom,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
a pretty good thing in the pike-staff line. Good
Lord, fancy me preaching to you. It&rsquo;s amusing,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed a little.</p>
<p>Elizabeth nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can go on,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>He considered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;ve got anything more to
say except that&mdash;things that puzzle one&mdash;there&rsquo;s
always the touchstone of reality. And things
one doesn&rsquo;t want to do because they&rsquo;re difficult,
or because they hurt, or because they take us
away from something we&rsquo;ve set our heart on&mdash;well&mdash;if
they&rsquo;re right, they&rsquo;re right, and there&rsquo;s
an end of it. And the right thing, well, it&rsquo;s the
best thing all round. And when we get where we
can see it properly, it&rsquo;s&mdash;well, it&rsquo;s trumps all
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth nodded again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Louis,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
shirking. I think I&rsquo;ve really known it all along.
Only when one shirks, it&rsquo;s part of it to wrap oneself
up in a sort of mist, and call everything by a
wrong name. I&rsquo;ve got to change my labels....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice died away, and they sat silent until
Agneta&rsquo;s key was heard in the latch. She came
in looking rested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice church?&rdquo; said Elizabeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Agneta, &ldquo;very nice. I feel better.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>During the week that followed, Elizabeth had
very little time to spare for her own concerns, and
Agneta clung to her and clung to hope, and day
by day the hope grew fainter. It was the half-hours
when they waited for the telephone bell to
ring that brought the grey threads into Agneta&rsquo;s
hair. Twice daily Louis rang up, and each time,
after the same agonising suspense, came the same
message, &ldquo;No news yet.&rdquo; Towards the end of the
week, there was a wire to say that a rumour had
reached the coast that Mr. Strange was alive and
on his way down the river.</p>
<p>It was then that Agneta broke down. Whilst
all had despaired, she had held desperately to
hope, but when Louis followed his message home,
he found Agneta with her head in Elizabeth&rsquo;s lap,
weeping slow, hopeless tears.</p>
<p>Then, forty-eight hours later, Douglas Strange
himself cabled in code to say that he had abandoned
part of his journey owing to a native
rising, and was returning at once to England.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, Lizabeth,&rdquo; said Agneta, &ldquo;now
your visit begins, please. This hasn&rsquo;t been a
visit, it has been purgatory. I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ve both
expiated all the sins we&rsquo;ve ever committed or are
likely to commit. Louis, take the receiver off that
brute of a telephone. I shall <i>never, never</i> hear a
telephone bell again without wanting to scream.
Lizabeth, let&rsquo;s go to a music hall.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>Next day Agneta said suddenly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lizabeth, what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Agneta&rsquo;s little dark face became serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lizabeth, I&rsquo;ve been a beast. I&rsquo;ve only been
thinking about myself. Now it&rsquo;s your turn.
What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth was silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mayn&rsquo;t I ask? Do you mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which is the &lsquo;no&rsquo; for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both,&rdquo; said Elizabeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mustn&rsquo;t ask then. You&rsquo;d rather not talk
about it? Really?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, really, Neta, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Agneta was silent for a few minutes. They
were sitting together in the firelight, and she
watched the play of light and shade upon Elizabeth&rsquo;s
face. It was beautiful, but troubled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lizabeth, you used not to be beautiful, but
you are beautiful now,&rdquo; she said suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I always loved your face, but it wasn&rsquo;t
really beautiful. Now I think it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo; Elizabeth laughed a little.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the patient look has gone. You used to
look so patient that it <i>hurt</i>. As if you were
carrying a heavy load and just knew you had got
to carry it without making any fuss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Issachar, in fact&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not then, but I&rsquo;m not so sure now. I
<i>think</i> there <i>are</i> two burdens now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth laid her hand on Agneta&rsquo;s lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agneta, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
Stop thought-reading this very minute. I never
gave you leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo; Agneta kissed the hand against her
lips and laid it back in Elizabeth&rsquo;s lap. &ldquo;Oh,
Lizabeth, <i>why</i> didn&rsquo;t you marry Louis?&rdquo; she
said, and Elizabeth saw that her eyes were full of
tears. The firelight danced on a brilliant, falling
drop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I love David,&rdquo; said Elizabeth.
&ldquo;And love is worth while, Agneta. It is very
well worth while. You knew it was when you
thought that Douglas was dead. Would you
have gone back to a year ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Lizabeth, don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Agneta.</p>
<p>She leaned her head against Elizabeth&rsquo;s knee
and was still.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>All that week, Elizabeth slept little and thought
much. And her thought was prayer. She did
not kneel when she prayed, and she had her own
idea of what prayer should be. Not petition.
The Kingdom of Heaven is about us. We have
but to open our eyes and take what is our
own. Therefore not petition. What Elizabeth
called prayer was far more like taking something
out of the darkness, to look at it in the light.
And before the light, all things evil, all things
that were not good and not of God, vanished and
were not. If thine eye be single, thy whole body
shall be full of light. In this manner, David&rsquo;s
sleeplessness had been changed to rest and healing,
and in this same manner, Elizabeth now knew that
she must test the strange dream-state in which
David loved her. And in her heart of hearts she
did not think that it would stand the test. She
believed that, subjected to this form of prayer,
the dream would vanish and she be left alone.</p>
<p>She faced the probability, and facing it, she
prayed for light, for wisdom, for the Reality that
annihilates the shadows of man&rsquo;s thought. When
she used words at all, they were the words of St.
Patrick&rsquo;s prayer:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I bind to myself to-day,</p>
<p class="t0">The Power of God to protect me,</p>
<p class="t0">The Might of God to uphold me,</p>
<p class="t0">The Wisdom of God to guide me,</p>
<p class="t0">The Light of God to shine upon me,</p>
<p class="t0">The Love of God to encompass me.</p>
</div>
<p>During these days Agneta looked at her
anxiously, but she asked no questions at all,
and Elizabeth loved her for it.</p>
<p>Elizabeth went home on the 15th of June.
After hard struggle, she had come into a place
of clear vision. If the dream stood the test, if in
spite of all her strivings towards Truth, David still
came to her, she would take the dream to be an
earnest of some future waking. If the dream
ceased, if David came no more, then she must
cast her bread of love upon the waters of the
Infinite, God only knowing, if after many days,
she should be fed.</p>
<p>David was very much pleased to have her
back. He told her so with a laugh&mdash;confessed
that he had missed her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<p>When Elizabeth went to her room that night,
she sat down on the window-seat and watched. It
had rained, but the night was clear again. She
looked from the window, and the midsummer
beauty slid into her soul. The rain had washed
the sky to an unearthly translucent purity, but
out of the west streamed a radiance of turquoise
light. It filled the night, and as it mounted
towards the zenith, the throbbing colour passed
by imperceptible degrees into a sapphire haze.
The horizon was a ghostly line of far, pure emerald.
This transfiguring glow had all the sunset&rsquo;s fire,
only there was neither red nor gold in it. The
ether itself flamed, and the colour of that flame
was blue. It was the light of vision, the very light
of a Midsummer&rsquo;s Dream. The cloud that had shed
the rain brooded apart with wings of folded gloom.
Two or three drifting feathers of dark grey vapour
barred the burning blue. Perishably fine, they
dissolved against the glow, and one amazing star
showed translucent at the vapour&rsquo;s edge, now
veiled, now blazing out as the mist wavered and
withdrew from so much brightness. A night for
love, a night for lovers&rsquo; dreams.</p>
<p>Yearning came upon Elizabeth like a flood.
Just once more to see him look at her with love.
Just once more&mdash;once more, to feel his arms, his
kiss&mdash;to weep upon his breast and say farewell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>She put her hand out waveringly until it touched
the wall. She shut her eyes against the beauty of
the night, and strove with the longing that rent
her. Her lips framed broken words. She said
them over and over again until the tumult died
in her, and she was mistress of her thoughts.
Immortal love could never lose by Truth.</p>
<p>Now she could look again upon the night. The
trees were very black. The wind stirred them.
The sky was full of light made mystical. Which
of the temples that man has built, has light for
its walls, and cloud and fire for its pillars? In
which of them has the sun his tabernacle, through
which of them does the moon pass, by a path of
silver adoration? What altar is served by the
rushing winds and lighted by the stars? In all
the temples that man has made, man bows his
head and worships, but in the Temple of the
Universe it is the Heavens themselves that declare
the Glory of God.</p>
<p>Elizabeth&rsquo;s thought rose up and up. In the
divine peace it rested and was stilled.</p>
<p>And David did not come.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>

<p class="t">And God said, It is good.</p>
</div>
<p>David came no more. The dream was done.
During the summer days there rang continually
in Elizabeth&rsquo;s ears the words of a song&mdash;one
of Christina&rsquo;s wonderful songs that sing themselves
with no other music at all.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The hope I dreamed of was a dream,</p>
<p class="t">Was but a dream, and now I wake</p>
<p class="t0">Exceeding comfortless, and worn, and old,</p>
<p class="t">For a dream&rsquo;s sake.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Exceeding comfortless.&rdquo; Yes, there were
hours when that was true. She had taken her
heart and broken it for Truth&rsquo;s sake, and the
broken thing cried aloud of its hurt. Only by
much striving could she still it and find peace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<p>The glamour of the June days was gone too.
July was a wet and stormy month, and Elizabeth
was thankful for the rain and the cold, at which
all the world was grumbling.</p>
<p>Mary came in one July day with a face that
matched the weather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Molly,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, kissing her,
&ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter, child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary might have asked the same question,
but she was a great deal too much taken up with
her own affairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Edward and I have quarrelled,&rdquo; she said
with a sob in the words, and sitting down, she
burst into uncontrollable tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what is it all about?&rdquo; asked Elizabeth,
with her arm around her sister. &ldquo;Molly, do
hush. It is so bad for you. What has Edward
done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men are brutes,&rdquo; declared Mary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;m sure Edward isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; returned
Elizabeth, with real conviction.</p>
<p>Mary sat up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;No, Liz, just listen.
It was all over baby&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, already?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course, one plans things. If one
doesn&rsquo;t, well, there was Dorothy Jackson&mdash;don&rsquo;t
you remember? She was very ill, and the baby
had to be christened in a hurry, because they
didn&rsquo;t think it was going to live. And nobody
thought the name mattered, so the clergyman just
gave it the first name that came into his head, and
the baby didn&rsquo;t die after all, and when Dorothy
found she&rsquo;d got to go through life with a daughter
called Harriet, she very nearly died all over again.
So, you see, one has to think of things. So I had
thought of a whole lot of names, and last night I
said to Edward, &lsquo;What shall we call it?&rsquo; and he
looked awfully pleased and said, &lsquo;What do you
think?&rsquo; And I said, &lsquo;What would you like best?&rsquo;
And he said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;d like it to be called after you,
Mary, darling. I got Jack Webster&rsquo;s answer to-day,
and he says I may call it anything I like.&rsquo;
Well, of <i>course</i>, I didn&rsquo;t see what it had to do with
Jack Webster, but I thought Edward must have
asked him to be godfather. I was rather put
out. I didn&rsquo;t think it quite <i>nice</i>, beforehand,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bright colour of indignation had come into
Mary&rsquo;s cheeks, and she spoke with great energy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of <i>course</i>, I just thought that, and then Edward
said, &lsquo;So it shall be called after you&mdash;Arachne
Mariana.&rsquo; I thought what <i>hideous</i> names, but
all I said was, &lsquo;Oh, darling, but I want a boy&rsquo;;
and do you know, Liz, Edward had been talking
about a spider all the time&mdash;the spider that Jack
Webster sent him. I don&rsquo;t believe he cares
nearly as much for the baby, I really don&rsquo;t, and I
wish I was <i>dead</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary sobbed afresh, and it took Elizabeth a
good deal of her time to pacify her.</p>
<p>Mrs. Havergill brought in tea, it being Sarah&rsquo;s
afternoon out. When she was taking away the
tea-things, after Mary had gone, she observed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Mottisfont, she do look pale, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Mottisfont is going to have a baby,&rdquo;
said Elizabeth, smiling.</p>
<p>Mrs. Havergill appeared to dismiss Mary&rsquo;s
baby with a slight wave of the hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I &rsquo;ad a cousin as &rsquo;ad twenty-three,&rdquo; she
observed in tones of lofty detachment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not all at once?&rdquo; said Elizabeth faintly.</p>
<p>Mrs. Havergill took no notice of this remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, twenty-three, pore soul. And when she
wasn&rsquo;t &rsquo;aving of them, she was burying of them.
Ten she buried, and thirteen she reared, and
many&rsquo;s the time I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;eard &rsquo;er say, she didn&rsquo;t
know which was the most trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>She went out with the tray, and later, when
Sarah had returned, she repeated Mrs. Blake&rsquo;s
information in tones of sarcasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s to be a baby at the Mottisfonts&rsquo;,&rsquo;
she says, as if I didn&rsquo;t know that. And I says,
&lsquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; and that&rsquo;s all as passed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Havergill had a way of forgetting her own
not inconsiderable contributions to a conversation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; I says, expecting every moment
as she&rsquo;d up and say, &rsquo;and one &rsquo;ere, too, Mrs.
Havergill,&rsquo; but no, not a blessed word, and me sure
of it for weeks. But there&mdash;they&rsquo;re all the same
with the first, every one&rsquo;s to be blind and deaf.
All the same, Sarah, my girl, if she don&rsquo;t want
it talked about, she don&rsquo;t, so just you mind and
don&rsquo;t talk, not if she don&rsquo;t say nothing till the
christening&rsquo;s ordered.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<p>When Elizabeth knew that she was going to
have a child, her first thought was, &ldquo;Now, I
must tell David,&rdquo; and her next, &ldquo;How can I tell
him, how can I possibly tell him?&rdquo; She lay on
her bed in the darkness and faced the situation.
If she told David, and he did not believe her&mdash;that
was possible, but not probable. If she told
him, and he believed her as to the facts&mdash;but
believed also that this strange development was
due in some way to some influence of hers&mdash;conscious
or unconscious hypnotism&mdash;the thought
broke off half-way. If he believed this&mdash;and it was
likely that he would believe it&mdash;Elizabeth covered
her eyes with her hand. Even the darkness was
no shield. How should she meet David&rsquo;s eyes
in the light, if he were to believe this? What
would he think of her? What must he think of
her? She began to weep slow tears of shame
and agony. What was she to do? To wait
until some accident branded her in David&rsquo;s eyes,
or to go to him with a most unbelievable tale?
She tried to find words that she could say, and
she could find none. Her flesh shrank, and
she knew that she could not do it. There were
no words. The tears ran slowly, very slowly,
between her fingers. Elizabeth was cold. The
room was full of the empty dark. All the world
was dark and empty too. She lay quite still for
a very long time. Then there came upon her a
curious gradual sense of companionship. It grew
continually. At the last, she took her hands from
before her face and opened her eyes. And there
was a light in the room. It shed no glow on anything&mdash;it
was just a light by itself. A steady,
golden light. It was not moonlight, for there was
no moon. Elizabeth lay and looked at it. It was
very radiant and very soft. She ceased to weep
and she ceased to be troubled. She knew with a
certainty that never faltered again, that she and
David were one. Whether he would become conscious
of their oneness during the space of this
short mortal dream, she did not know, but it had
ceased to matter. The thing that had tormented
her was her own doubt. Now that was stilled
for ever&mdash;Love walked again among the realities,
pure and unashamed. The things of Time&mdash;the
mistakes, the illusions, the shadows of Time&mdash;moved
in a little misty dream, that could not
touch her. Elizabeth turned on her side. She
was warm and she was comforted.</p>
<p>She slept.</p>

</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember my telling you about my
dream?&rdquo; said David, next day. He spoke
quite suddenly, looking up from a letter that he
was writing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember,&rdquo; said Elizabeth. She even
smiled a little.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it was so odd&mdash;I really don&rsquo;t know what
made me think of it just now, but it happened to
come into my head&mdash;do you know that I dreamt
it every night for about a fortnight? That was
in May. I have never done such a thing before.
Then it stopped again quite suddenly, and I
haven&rsquo;t dreamt it since. I wonder whether
speaking of it to you&mdash;&rdquo; he broke off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said Elizabeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see it came again and again. And the
strange part was that I used to wake in the morning
feeling as if there was a lot more of it. A lot
more than there used to be. Things I couldn&rsquo;t
remember&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know why I tell you this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It interests me,&rdquo; said Elizabeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know how one forgets a dream, and then,
quite suddenly, you just don&rsquo;t remember it. It&rsquo;s
the queerest thing&mdash;something gets the impression,
but the brain doesn&rsquo;t record it. It&rsquo;s most amazingly
provoking. Just now, while I was writing
to Fossett, bits of something came over me like
a flash. And now it&rsquo;s gone again. Do you ever
dream?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; said Elizabeth.</p>
<p>This was her time to tell him. But Elizabeth
did not tell him. It seemed to her that she had
been told, quite definitely, to wait, and she was
dimly aware of the reason. The time was not yet.</p>
<p>David finished his letter. Then he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to go away this summer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, a little surprised. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think I do. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">245</div>
<p>&ldquo;Most people seem to go away. Mary would
like you to go with her, wouldn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I&rsquo;ve told her I don&rsquo;t want to go.
She won&rsquo;t be alone, you know, now that Edward
finds that he can get away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor old Edward,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A month ago
the business couldn&rsquo;t get on without him. He
was conscience-ridden, and snatched exiguous
half-hours for Mary and his beetles. And now
it appears, that after all, the business can get on
without him. I don&rsquo;t know quite how Macpherson
brought that fact home to Edward. He
must have put it very straight, and I&rsquo;m afraid
that Edward&rsquo;s feelings were a good deal hurt.
Personally, I should say that the less Edward
interferes with Macpherson the more radiantly
will bank-managers smile upon Edward. Edward
is a well-meaning person. Mr. Mottisfont would
have called him damn well-meaning. And you
cannot damn any man deeper than that in business.
No, Edward can afford to take a holiday
better than most people. He will probably start
a marine collection and be perfectly happy. Why
don&rsquo;t you join them for a bit?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I want to,&rdquo; said Elizabeth.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going up to London for Agneta&rsquo;s wedding
next week. I don&rsquo;t want to go anywhere else.
Do you want to get rid of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To her surprise, David coloured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo; he said. For a moment an odd expression
passed across his face. Then he laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might have wanted to flirt with Miss Dobell.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Agneta Mainwaring was married at the end of
July.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be the most awful show,&rdquo; she
wrote to Elizabeth. &ldquo;Douglas and I spend all
our time trying to persuade each other that it
isn&rsquo;t going to be awful, but we know it is. All
our relations and all our friends, and all their
children and all their best clothes, and an amount
of fuss, worry, and botheration calculated to drive
any one crazy. If I hadn&rsquo;t an enormous amount
of self-control I should bolt, either with or without
Douglas. Probably without him. Then he&rsquo;d
have a really thrilling time tracking me down.
It&rsquo;s an awful temptation, and if you don&rsquo;t want
me to give way to it, you&rsquo;d better come up at
least three days beforehand, and clamp on to me.
Do come, Lizabeth. I really want you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">247</div>
<p>Elizabeth went up to London the day before
the wedding, and Agneta detached herself sufficiently
from her own dream to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not Issachar any longer. What has
happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite know,&rdquo; said Elizabeth. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think the burden&rsquo;s gone, but I think that
some one else is carrying it for me. I don&rsquo;t seem
to feel it any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Agneta smiled a queer little smile of understanding.
Then she laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Heavens, Lizabeth, if any one heard us
talking, how perfectly mad they would think
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth found August a very peaceful month.
A large number of her friends and acquaintances
were away. There were no calls to be paid and
no notes to be written. She and David were
more together than they had been since the time
in Switzerland, and she was happy with a strange
brooding happiness, which was not yet complete,
but which awaited completion. She thought a
great deal about the child&mdash;the child of the Dream.
She came to think of it as an indication that behind
the Dream was the Real.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">248</div>
<p>Mary came back on the 15th of September.
She was looking very well, and was once more in a
state of extreme contentment with Edward and
things in general. When she had poured forth
a complete catalogue of all that they had done,
she paused for breath, and looked suddenly and
sharply at Elizabeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Liz,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Why, Liz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Elizabeth&rsquo;s annoyance, she felt herself
colouring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Liz, and you never told me. Tell me at once.
Is it true? Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Molly, what an Inquisitor you would
have made!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it <i>is</i> true. And I suppose you told
Agneta weeks ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t told any one,&rdquo; said Elizabeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Agneta? And I suppose if I hadn&rsquo;t
guessed you wouldn&rsquo;t have told me for ages and
ages and ages. Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me, Liz?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I thought I&rsquo;d wait till you came back,
Molly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary caught her sister&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
<p>&ldquo;Liz, aren&rsquo;t you glad? Aren&rsquo;t you pleased?
Doesn&rsquo;t it make you happy? Oh, Liz, if I thought
you were one of those <i>dreadful</i> women who don&rsquo;t
want to have a baby, I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what I
should do. I wanted to tell everybody. But
then I was <i>pleased</i>. I don&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re a bit
pleased. Are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that pleased is exactly the word,&rdquo;
said Elizabeth. She looked at Mary and laughed
a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Molly, do stop being Mrs. Grundy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary lifted her chin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just because I was interested,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
suppose you&rsquo;d rather I didn&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she relaxed a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Liz, I&rsquo;m frightfully excited. Do be pleased
and excited too. Why are you so stiff and odd?
Isn&rsquo;t David pleased?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had looked away, but she turned quickly
at the last words, and fixed her eyes on Elizabeth&rsquo;s
face. And for a moment Elizabeth had been off
her guard.</p>
<p>Mary exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he pleased? Doesn&rsquo;t he know? Liz,
you don&rsquo;t mean to tell me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you give me much time to tell
you anything, Molly,&rdquo; said Elizabeth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">250</div>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t know? Liz, what&rsquo;s happened to
you? Why are you so extraordinary? It&rsquo;s the
sort of thing you read about in an early
Victorian novel. Do you mean to say that you
<i>really</i> haven&rsquo;t told David? That he doesn&rsquo;t
know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth&rsquo;s colour rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Molly, my dear, do you think it is your business?&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;I suppose you won&rsquo;t
pretend you&rsquo;re not my own sister. And I think
you must be quite mad, Liz. I do, indeed. You
ought to tell David at once&mdash;at once. I can&rsquo;t
<i>imagine</i> what Edward would have said if he had not
known at once. You ought to go straight home
and tell him now. Married people ought to be
one. They ought never to have secrets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary poured the whole thing out to Edward the
same evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know what has happened to
Elizabeth,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She is quite changed. I
can&rsquo;t understand her at all. I think it is quite
wicked of her. If she doesn&rsquo;t tell David soon,
some one else ought to tell him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edward moved uneasily in his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People don&rsquo;t like being interfered with,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">251</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sure nobody could call me an
interfering person,&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t interfering
to be fond of people. If I weren&rsquo;t fond of
Liz, I shouldn&rsquo;t care how strangely she behaved.
I do think it&rsquo;s very strange of her&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t
care what you say, Edward. I think David ought
to be told. How would you have liked it if I&rsquo;d
hidden things from you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edward rumpled up his hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People <i>don&rsquo;t</i> like being interfered with,&rdquo; he
said again.</p>
<p>At this Mary burst into tears, and continued
to weep until Edward had called himself a brute
sufficiently often to justify her contradicting him.</p>
<p>Elizabeth continued to wait. She was not quite
as untroubled as she had been. The scene with
Mary had brought the whole world of other
people&rsquo;s thoughts and judgments much nearer.
It was a troubling world. One full of shadows
and perplexities. It pressed upon her a little and
vexed her peace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">252</div>
<p>The days slid by. They had been pleasant days
for David, too. For some time past he had been
aware of a change in himself&mdash;a ferment. His old
passion for Mary was dust. He looked back upon
it now, and saw it as a delirium of the senses, a
thing of change and fever. It was gone. He
rejoiced in his freedom and began to look forward
to the time when he and Elizabeth would enter
upon a married life founded upon friendship,
companionship, and good fellowship. He had no
desire to fall in love with Elizabeth, to go back to
the old storms of passion and unrest. He cared a
good deal for Elizabeth. When she was his wife
he would care for her more deeply, but still on the
same lines. He hoped that they would have
children. He was very fond of children. And
then, after he had planned it all out in his own
mind, he became aware of the change, the ferment.
What he felt did not come into the plan at all.
He disliked it and he distrusted it, but none the
less the change went on, the ferment grew. It
was as if he had planned to walk on a clear, wide
upland, under a still, untroubled air. In his own
mind he had a vision of such a place. It was a
place where a man might walk and be master of
himself, and then suddenly&mdash;the driving of a
mighty wind, and he could not tell from whence it
came, or whither it went. The wind bloweth
where it listeth. In those September days the
wind blew very strongly, and as it blew, David
came slowly to the knowledge that he loved
Elizabeth. It was a love that seemed to rise in
him from some great depth. He could not have
told when it began. As the days passed, he
wondered sometimes whether it had not been
there always, deep amongst the deepest springs
of thought and will. There was no fever in it.
It was a thing so strong and sane and wholesome
that, after the first wonder, it seemed to him to be
a part of himself, a part which, missing, he had
lost balance and mental poise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">253</div>
<p>He spoke to Elizabeth as usual, but he looked
at her with new eyes. And he, too, waited.</p>
<p>He came home one day to find the household in a
commotion. It appeared that Sarah had scalded
her hand, Elizabeth was out, and Mrs. Havergill
was divided between the rival merits of flour, oil,
and a patent preparation which she had found very
useful when suffering from chilblains. She safeguarded
her infallibility by remarking, that there
was some as held with one thing and some as held
with another. She also observed, that &ldquo;scalds
were &rsquo;orrid things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, there was an &rsquo;ousemaid I knew, Milly
Clarke her name was, she scalded her hand very
much the same as you &rsquo;ave, Sarah, and first thing,
it swelled up as big as my two legs and arter that
it turned to blood-poisoning, and the doctors
couldn&rsquo;t do nothing for her, pore girl.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">254</div>
<p>At this point Sarah broke into noisy weeping
and David arrived. When he had bound up the
hand, consoled the trembling Sarah, and suggested
that she should have a cup of tea, he inquired
where Elizabeth was. She might be at Mrs.
Mottisfont&rsquo;s, suggested Mrs. Havergill, as she
followed him into the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not thinking of sending Sarah to the
&rsquo;orspital, are you sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not, she&rsquo;ll be all right in a day
or two. I&rsquo;ll just walk up the hill and meet Mrs.
Blake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s a mercy she were out,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Havergill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said David, turning at the door. Mrs.
Havergill assumed an air of matronly importance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might ha&rsquo; given her a turn,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for
the pore girl did scream something dreadful. I&rsquo;m
sure it give me a turn, but that&rsquo;s neither here nor
there. What I was thinking of was Mrs. Blake&rsquo;s
condition, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Havergill was obviously a little nettled
at David&rsquo;s expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said David quickly.</p>
<p>Mrs. Havergill went back to Sarah.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">255</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nonsense,&rsquo; he says, and him a doctor. Why,
there was me own pore mother as died with her
ninth, and all along of a turn she got through seeing
a child run over. And he says, &lsquo;Nonsense.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>David walked up the hill in a state of mind
between impatience and amusement. How women&rsquo;s
minds did run on babies. He supposed it
was natural, but there were times when one could
dispense with it.</p>
<p>He found Mary at home and alone. &ldquo;Elizabeth?
Oh, no, she hasn&rsquo;t been near me for days,&rdquo;
said Mary. &ldquo;As it happened, I particularly
<i>wanted</i> to see her. But she hasn&rsquo;t been near me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She considered that Elizabeth was neglecting
her. Only that morning she had told Edward so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t come to see me <i>on purpose</i>,&rdquo; she
had said. &ldquo;But I know quite well why. I don&rsquo;t
at all approve of the way she&rsquo;s going on, and she
knows it. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s <i>right</i>. I think some
one ought to tell David. No, Edward, I really
do. I don&rsquo;t understand Elizabeth at all, and she&rsquo;s
simply afraid to come and see me because she
knows that I shall speak my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, as she sat and talked to David, the idea
that it might be her duty to enlighten him presented
itself to her mind afresh. A sudden and
brilliant idea came into her head, and she immediately
proceeded to act upon it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">256</div>
<p>&ldquo;I had a special reason for wanting to see her,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;I had a lovely box of things down
from town on approval, and I wanted her to see
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things?&rdquo; said David.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, clothes,&rdquo; said Mary, with a wave of the
hand. &ldquo;You know they&rsquo;ll send you anything
now. By the way, I bought a present for Liz,
though she doesn&rsquo;t <i>deserve</i> it. Will you take it
down to her? I&rsquo;ll get it if you don&rsquo;t mind waiting
a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was away for five minutes, and then returned
with a small brown-paper parcel in her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can open it when you get home,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Open it and show it to Liz, and see whether
you like it. Tell her I sent it with my <i>love</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now there won&rsquo;t be any more nonsense,&rdquo; she
told Edward.</p>
<p>Edward looked rather unhappy, but, warned
by previous experience, said nothing.</p>
<p>David found Elizabeth in the dining-room.
She was putting a large bunch of scarlet gladioli
into a brown jug upon the mantelpiece.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a present for you,&rdquo; said David.</p>
<p>&ldquo;David, how nice of you. It&rsquo;s not my birthday.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">257</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s not from me at all. I looked
in to see if you were with Mary, and she sent you
this, with her love. By the way, you&rsquo;d better go
and see her, I think she&rsquo;s rather huffed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke he was undoing the parcel. Elizabeth
had her back towards him. The flowers
would not stand up just as she wished them to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think why Molly should send me a
present,&rdquo; she said, and then all at once something
made her turn round.</p>
<p>The brown-paper wrapping lay on the table.
David had taken something white out of the
parcel. He held it up and they both looked at it.
It was a baby&rsquo;s robe, very fine, and delicately
embroidered.</p>
<p>Elizabeth made a wavering step forward. The
light danced on the white robe, and not only on
the robe. All the room was full of small dancing
lights. Elizabeth put her hand behind her and
felt for the edge of the mantelpiece. She could
not find it. Everything was shaking. She swung
half round, and all the dancing lights flashed in her
eyes as she fell forwards.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">258</div>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXIV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE LOST NAME</span></h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">You are as old as Egypt, and as young as yesterday,</p>
<p class="t">Oh, turn again and look again, for when you look I know</p>
<p class="t0">The dusk of death is but a dream, that dreaming, dies away</p>
<p class="t">And leaves you with the lips I loved, three thousand years ago.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The mists of that forgotten dream, they fill your brooding eyes,</p>
<p class="t">With veil on strange revealing veil that wavers, and is gone,</p>
<p class="t0">And still between the veiling mists, the dim, dead centuries rise,</p>
<p class="t">And still behind the farthest veil, your burning soul burns on.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">You are as old as Egypt, and as young as very Youth,</p>
<p class="t">Before your still, immortal eyes the ages come and go,</p>
<p class="t0">The dusk of death is but a dream that dims the face of Truth&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">Oh, turn again, and look again, for when you look, I know.</p>
</div>
<p>When Elizabeth came to herself, the room
was full of mist. Through the mist, she
saw David&rsquo;s face, and quite suddenly in these few
minutes it had grown years older.</p>
<p>He spoke. He seemed a long way off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drink this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said Elizabeth faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Water.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">259</div>
<p>Elizabeth raised herself a little and drank. The
faintness passed. She became aware that the
collar of her dress was unfastened, and she sat up
and began to fasten it.</p>
<p>David got up, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no mist before Elizabeth&rsquo;s eyes now.
They saw clearly, quite, quite clearly. She looked
at David, and David&rsquo;s face was grey&mdash;old and
grey. So it had come. Now in this hour of
physical weakness. The thing she dreaded.</p>
<p>To her own surprise, she felt no dread now.
Only a great weariness. What could she say?
What was she to say? All seemed useless&mdash;not
worth while. But then there was David&rsquo;s face,
his grey, old face. She must do her best&mdash;not for
her own sake, but for David&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>She wondered a little that it should hurt him so
much. It was not as though he loved her, or had
ever loved her. Only of course this was a thing to
cut a man, down to the very quick of his pride and
his self-respect. It was that&mdash;of course it was that.</p>
<p>Whilst she was thinking, David spoke. He was
standing by the table fingering the piece of string
that lay there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elizabeth, do you know why you fainted?&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">260</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, and said no more.</p>
<p>A sort of shudder passed over David Blake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; he said in a voice that was
hardly a voice at all. There was a sound, and
there were words. But it was not like a man
speaking. It was like a long, quick breath of
pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Elizabeth. &ldquo;It is true, David.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a very great pity in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my God!&rdquo; said David, and he sat down by
the table and put his head in his hands. &ldquo;Oh, my
God!&rdquo; he said again.</p>
<p>Elizabeth got up. She was trembling just a
little, but she felt no faintness now. She put one
hand on the mantelpiece, and so stood, waiting.</p>
<p>There was a very long silence, one of those profound
silences which seem to break in upon a room
and fill it. They overlie and blot out all the little
sounds of every-day life and usage. Outside,
people came and went, the traffic in the High
Street came and went, but neither to David, nor
to Elizabeth, did there come the smallest sound.
They were enclosed in a silence that seemed to
stretch unbroken, from one Eternity to another.
It became an unbearable torment. To his dying
day, when any one spoke of hell, David glimpsed
a place of eternal silence, where anguish burned
for ever with a still unwavering flame.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">261</div>
<p>He moved at last, slowly, like a man who has
been in a trance. His head lifted. He got up,
resting his weight upon his hands. Then he
straightened himself. All his movements were
like those of a man who is lifting an intolerably
heavy load.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you marry me?&rdquo; he asked in a tired
voice, and then his tone hardened. &ldquo;Who is the
man? Who is he? Will he marry you if I
divorce you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>An unbearable pang of pity went through
Elizabeth, and she turned her head sharply.
David stopped looking at her.</p>
<p>She to be ashamed&mdash;oh, God!&mdash;Elizabeth
ashamed&mdash;he could not look at her. He walked
quickly to the window. Then turned back again
because Elizabeth was speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;David,&rdquo; she said, in a low voice, &ldquo;David,
what sort of woman am I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A groan burst from David.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">262</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are a good woman. That&rsquo;s just the
damnable part of it. There are some women,
when they do a thing like this, one only says
they&rsquo;ve done after their kind&mdash;they&rsquo;re gone
where they belong. When a good woman does
it, it&rsquo;s Hell&mdash;just Hell. And you&rsquo;re a good
woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth was looking down. She could not
bear his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And would you say I was a truthful woman?&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;If I were to tell you the truth, would
you believe me, David?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said David at once. &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;d believe
you. If you told me anything at all you&rsquo;d tell
me the truth. Why shouldn&rsquo;t I believe you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because the truth is very unbelievable,&rdquo;
said Elizabeth.</p>
<p>David lifted his head and looked at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll not lie,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Elizabeth. After a moment&rsquo;s
pause, she went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you sit down, David? I don&rsquo;t think I
can speak if you walk up and down like that. It&rsquo;s
not very easy to speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat down in a big chair, that stood with its
back to the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;David,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;when we were in Switzerland,
you asked me how I had put you to sleep.
You asked me if I had hypnotised you. I said,
No. I want to know if you believed me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">263</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I believed,&rdquo; said David
wearily. The question appeared to him to be
entirely irrelevant and unimportant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you hypnotise a person, you are producing
an illusion,&rdquo; said Elizabeth. &ldquo;The effect
of what I did was to destroy one. But whatever
I did, when you asked me to stop doing it, I
stopped. You do believe that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I believe that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stopped at once&mdash;definitely. You must
please believe that. Presently you will see why
I say this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the time she had been standing quietly
by the mantelpiece. Now she came across and
kneeled down beside David&rsquo;s chair. She laid her
hands one above the other upon the broad arm,
and she looked, not at David at all, but at her
own hands. It was the penitent&rsquo;s attitude, but
David Blake, looking at her, found nothing of the
penitent&rsquo;s expression. The light shone full upon
her face. There was a look upon it that startled
him. Her face was white and still. The look
that riveted David&rsquo;s attention was a look of
remoteness&mdash;passionless remoteness&mdash;and over all
a sort of patience.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">264</div>
<p>Elizabeth looked down at her strong folded
hands, and began to speak in a quiet, gentle
voice. The sapphire in her ring caught the light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;David, just now you asked me why I married
you. You never asked me that before. I am
going to tell you now. I married you because I
loved you very much. I thought I could help,
and I loved you. That is why I married you.
You won&rsquo;t speak, please, till I have done. It
isn&rsquo;t easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She drew a long, steady breath and went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you didn&rsquo;t love me, you loved Mary.
It wasn&rsquo;t good for you. I knew that you would
never love me. I was&mdash;content&mdash;with friendship.
You gave me friendship. Then we came
home. And you stopped loving Mary. I was
very thankful&mdash;for you&mdash;not for myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped for a moment. David was looking
at her. Her words fell on his heart, word after
word, like scalding tears. So she had loved him&mdash;it
only needed that. Why did she tell him now
when it was all too late&mdash;hideously too late?</p>
<p>Elizabeth went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember, when we had been home
a week, you dreamed your dream? Your old
dream&mdash;you told me of it, one evening&mdash;but I
knew already&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">265</div>
<p>&ldquo;Knew?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t speak. I can&rsquo;t go on if you speak.
I knew because when you dreamed your dream
you came to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She bent lower over her hands. Her breathing
quickened. She scarcely heard David&rsquo;s startled
exclamation. She must say it&mdash;and it was so
hard. Her heart beat so&mdash;it was so hard to steady
her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You came into my room. It was late. The
window was open, and the wind was blowing in.
The moon was going down. I was standing by
the window in my night-dress&mdash;and you spoke.
You said, &lsquo;Turn round, and let me see your face.&rsquo;
Then I turned round and you came to me and
touched me. You touched me and you spoke,
and then you went away. And the next night
you came again. You were in your dream, and in
your dream you loved me. We talked. I said,
&lsquo;Who am I?&rsquo; and you said, &lsquo;You are the Woman of
my Dream,&rsquo; and you kissed me, and then you
went away. But the third night&mdash;the third night&mdash;I
woke up&mdash;in the dark&mdash;and you were
there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">266</div>
<p>After that first start, David sat rigid and
watched her face. He saw her lips quiver&mdash;the
patience of her face break into pain. He knew
the effort with which she spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You came every night&mdash;for a fortnight. I
used to think you would wake&mdash;but you never
did. You went away before the dawn&mdash;always.
You never waked&mdash;you never remembered. In
your dream you loved me&mdash;you loved me very
much. In the daytime you didn&rsquo;t love me at all.
I got to feel I couldn&rsquo;t bear it. I went away to
Agneta, and there I thought it all out. I knew
what I had to do. I think I had really known all
along. But I was shirking. That&rsquo;s why it
hurt so much. If you shirk, you always get
hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth paused for a moment. She was
looking at the blue of her ring. It shone. There
was a little star in the heart of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very difficult to explain,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
suppose you would say I prayed. Do you remember
asking me, if you had slept because I saw you
in the Divine Consciousness? That&rsquo;s the nearest
I can get to explaining. I tried to see the whole
thing&mdash;us&mdash;the Dream&mdash;in the Divine Consciousness,
and you stopped dreaming. I knew you
would. You never came any more. That&rsquo;s
all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">267</div>
<p>Elizabeth stopped speaking. She moved as if
to rise, but David&rsquo;s hand fell suddenly upon both
of hers, and rested there with a hard, heavy
pressure.</p>
<p>He said her name, &ldquo;Elizabeth!&rdquo; and then
again, &ldquo;Elizabeth!&rdquo; His voice had a bewildered
sound.</p>
<p>Elizabeth lifted her eyes and looked at him.
His face was working, twitching, his eyes strained
as if to see something beyond the line of vision.
He looked past Elizabeth as he had done
in his dream. All at once he spoke in a
whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remembered, it&rsquo;s gone again&mdash;but I remembered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dream?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not the dream. I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;it&rsquo;s
gone. It was a name&mdash;your name&mdash;but it&rsquo;s
gone again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;it&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter, David.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth had begun to tremble, and all at once
he became aware of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you tremble?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">268</div>
<p>Elizabeth was at the end of her strength. She
had done what she had to do. If he would let her
go&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;David, let me go,&rdquo; she said, only just above
her breath.</p>
<p>Instead, he put out his other hand and touched
her on the breast. It was like the Dream. But
they were not in the Dream any more. They
were awake.</p>
<p>David leaned slowly forward, and Elizabeth
could not turn away her eyes. They looked at
each other, and the thing that had happened
before came upon them again. A momentary
flash&mdash;memory&mdash;revelation&mdash;truth. The moment
passed. This time it left behind it, not darkness,
but light. They were in the light, because love is
of the light.</p>
<p>David put his arms about Elizabeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine!&rdquo; he said.</p>

<h3 id="c27">A Marriage under the Terror</h3>
<p class="center"><i><b>$1.35 net. ($1.50 by mail)</b></i></p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the remarkable book that won the first
prize ($1250) in the Melrose Novel Competition. Not
since Dickens&rsquo;s <i>Tale of Two Cities</i> came from the presses
has the very atmosphere of the Terror been so remarkably
conveyed to the printed pages. We commend
it less because it won a prize than because it is one.&rdquo;

<h3 id="c28">More Than Kin</h3>
<p class="center"><i><b>$1.35 net. (By mail, $1.50)</b></i></p>
<p>Shows France in the throes of the Revolution; depicts
the relentless malice of the leaders of the bloodthirsty
hordes that swarmed through the streets of Paris; gives
us a thrilling account of hair-breadth escapes and
daring rescues; and withal presents a love story in
which the tender blends with the heroic.</p>
<h3 id="c29">The Devil&rsquo;s Wind</h3>
<p class="center"><i><b>$1.35 net. (By mail, $1.50)</b></i></p>
<p>&ldquo;A novel dealing with the dramatic days of the
Indian Mutiny, well written, well characterized, and
enriched by sundry jewels of description. Decidedly
one of the season&rsquo;s best historical romances.&rdquo;
<span class="jr"><i>Chicago Record-Herald.</i></span></p>
<h2 id="c30"><span class="h2line1">The Fringe of the Desert</span></h2>
<p class="center"><i>By</i> <b>R. S. Macnamara</b></p>
<p class="center"><i><b>12<sup>o</sup>. $1.35 net. By mail, $1.50</b></i></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>And the Wise Man said: &lsquo;Those who love with
passion stand on the Fringe of the Desert&rsquo;; and they
who heard laughed and passed on their way.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The atmosphere of Egypt glows and
pulsates through the story, giving to the
author an opportunity of showing that,
not only figuratively but literally, these
two lovers, Ingram and Hesper, stood on
the Fringe of the Desert. It was her power
of calling up vivid pictures of Egypt and
the Desert that caused critics to compare
a former story of Miss Macnamara&rsquo;s with
the work of those magicians of the East,
Robert Hichens and Pierre Loti. This
new book promises to emphasize her
strength in that particular.</p>
<h2 id="c31"><span class="h2line1">The Knave of Diamonds</span></h2>
<p class="center"><i>By</i> <b>Ethel M. Dell</b></p>
<p class="center"><i>Frontispiece in Color and Decorated Wrapper.
<br />$1.35 net. By mail, $1.50</i></p>
<p class="center"><b>The Great New Story by the Author of
<br /><span class="large">&ldquo;<span class="u">The Way of an Eagle</span>&rdquo;</span></b></p>
<p>With masterly skill Miss Dell has depicted
the domination of love and its effacing strength
when called upon to blot out from the memory
an offense which only love could forgive. The
struggle of the hero, a savage at heart, to emancipate
himself from the sinister tendencies of his
nature and to rise to the standard which the
woman he loves is entitled to claim, is told in a
story full of romance and adventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the most satisfactory love stories we
have read in a long while. Everybody will like
it, from the dyspeptic and elderly reader to
the young person who swallows &rsquo;em whole. The
characters are alive and interesting.... The
author seems to be a natural story-teller. Her
book will undoubtedly have a great success.&rdquo;

<p class="center"><span class="smaller"><i>From the author of &ldquo;THE ROSARY,&rdquo; Florence L. Barclay:</i></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Little Thank You will remain in the memory as
one of the most human and lovable of story-book
characters.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a gem: full of fascinating charm,
which seems to me unique. There have
been charming love stories and charming
child stories, but in your book we have the
two combined into a perfect whole. Do
accept my warmest congratulations and
good wishes for its success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing could be more daintily written
and presented than this fascinating story....
A little gem.&rdquo;
